      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>f ther&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t a
      flare-up in <i>this</i> haouse &rsquo;fore long, I miss <i>my</i> guess,&rdquo;
       said Alvira, as she kneaded the pie-crust, and pulled it out between her
      floury fingers to measure its consistency. &ldquo;Ole Sabriny&rsquo;s got her back up
      this time to stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let &rsquo;em flare, says I. &rsquo;Taint none o&rsquo; aour business,
      Alviry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knaow, Milton; but still it seems to me she might wait at least till
      th&rsquo; corpse was aout o&rsquo; th&rsquo; haouse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s thet got to dew with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The callousness of the question must have grated upon the hired-girl, for
      she made no reply, and slapped the dough over on the board with an
      impatient gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was near the close of a fair day, late in May, and the reddened
      sunlight from the West would have helped to glorify any human being less
      hopelessly commonplace than Milton Squires as he sat in its full radiance
      on the doorstep, peeling and quartering apples over a pan which he held
      between his knees. This sunlight, to reach him, painted with warm tints
      many objects near at hand which it could not make picturesque. The three
      great barns, standing in the shadow to the south, were ricketty and
      ancient without being comely, and the glare only made their awkward
      outlines and patched, paintless surfaces the meaner; the score of lean
      cows, standing idly fetlock-deep in the black mire of the barnyard, or
      nipping the scant tufts of rank grass near the trough, seemed all the
      dingier and scrawnier for the brilliancy of the light which covered them;
      the broken gate, the bars eked out with a hop-pole, the wheelbarrow turned
      shiftlessly against a break in the wall, the mildewed wellcurb, with its
      antiquated reach&mdash;all seemed in this glow of dying day to be
      conscious of exhibiting at its worse their squalid side. The sunset could
      not well have illumined, during that hour at least, a less inspiring scene
      than this which Alvira, looking out as she talked, or the hired man,
      raising his head from over the apples, could see from the kitchen door of
      Lemuel Fairchild&rsquo;s farm-house. But any student of his species would have
      agreed that, in all the uninviting view, Milton was the least attractive
      object.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he rose to empty his pan within, and start afresh, he could be seen
      more fully. He was clumsily cased from neck to ankles in brown over-alls,
      threadbare, discolored, patched, with mud about the knees and ragged edges
      lower down. He wore rubber boots, over the bulging legs of which the
      trousers came reluctantly, and the huge feet of these were slit down the
      instep. His hat had been soft and black once; now it seemed stiffened with
      dirt, to which the afternoon milking had lent a new contribution of short
      reddish hair, and was shapeless and colorless from age. His back was
      narrow and bent, and his long arms terminated in hands which it seemed
      sinful to have touch anything thereafter to be eaten. Viewed from behind,
      Milton appeared to be at least fifty. But his face showed a somewhat
      younger man, despite its sun-baked lines and the frowzy beard which might
      be either the yellow of unkempt youth or the gray of untidy age. In
      reality he was not yet thirty-six.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slouched out now with a fresh lot of apples, and, squatting on the
      door-stone, resumed the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose naow Sissly&rsquo;s gone, ther&rsquo; won&rsquo;t be no livin&rsquo; under th&rsquo; same roof
      with Sabriny fer any of us. Ther&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t nobuddy lef&rsquo; fer her to rassle
      with &rsquo;cep&rsquo; us. Ole Lemuel&rsquo;s so broken-up, he won&rsquo;t dare say his
      soul&rsquo;s his own; &rsquo;n John&mdash;well, Lize Wilkins says she heerd him
      say he didn&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s he&rsquo;d come to th&rsquo; funer&rsquo;l &rsquo;t all, after th&rsquo; way
      him &rsquo;n&rsquo; Sabriny hed it aout las&rsquo; time he was here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t talkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; <i>them!</i>&rdquo; said Alvira, slapping the flour from
      her hands&rsquo; and beginning with the roller; &ldquo;it&rsquo;d be nothin&rsquo; new, her tryin&rsquo;
      to boss <i>them</i>. But she&rsquo;s got her dander up naow agin somebuddy that
      beats them all holler. They won&rsquo;t no Richardsons come puttin&rsquo; on airs &rsquo;raoun&rsquo;
      here, an&rsquo; takin&rsquo; th&rsquo; parlor bedroom &rsquo;thaout askin&rsquo;, not ef th&rsquo; ole
      lady knaows herself&mdash;&rsquo;n&rsquo; I guess she does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Richardsons?&rdquo; asked Milton. &ldquo;Thought Sissly was th&rsquo; last of &rsquo;em&mdash;thet
      they wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t no more Richardsons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, man alive, ain&rsquo;t Albert&rsquo;s wife a Richardson, th&rsquo; daughter of
      Sissly&rsquo;s cousin&mdash;you remember, that pock-pitted man who kep&rsquo; th&rsquo; fast
      hoss here one summer. Of course she&rsquo;s a Richardson&mdash;full-blooded!
      When she come up from th&rsquo; train here this mornin&rsquo;, with Albert, I see by
      th&rsquo; ole lady&rsquo;s eye &rsquo;t she meant misch&rsquo;f. I didn&rsquo;t want to see no
      raow, here with a corpse in th&rsquo; haouse, &rsquo;n&rsquo; so I tried to smooth
      matters over, &rsquo;n&rsquo; kind o&rsquo; quiet Sabriny daown, tellin&rsquo; her thet
      they had to come to th&rsquo; fu-ner&rsquo;l, &rsquo;n&rsquo; they&rsquo;d go &rsquo;way soon&rsquo;s
      it was through with, &rsquo;n&rsquo; that Albert, bein&rsquo; the oldest son, hed a
      right to th&rsquo; comp&rsquo;ny bed-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;N&rsquo; what&rsquo;d she say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t say much, &rsquo;cep&rsquo; thet th&rsquo; Richardsons hed never brung
      nothin&rsquo; but bad luck to this haouse, &rsquo;n&rsquo; they never would, nuther.
      &rsquo;N&rsquo; then she flaounced upstairs to her room, jis&rsquo;s she allus does
      when she&rsquo;s riled, &rsquo;n&rsquo; she give Albert&rsquo;s wife sech a look, I said to
      m&rsquo;self, &lsquo;Milady, I wouldn&rsquo;t be in <i>your</i> shoes fer all yer fine
      fixin&rsquo;s.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s a dum likely lookin&rsquo; woman, ef she <i>is</i> a Richardson,&rdquo;
       said Milton, with something like enthusiasm. &ldquo;Wonder ef she wears one o&rsquo;
      them low-necked gaowns when she&rsquo;s to hum, like th&rsquo; picters in th&rsquo; <i>Ledger</i>.
      They say they all dew, in New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haow sh&rsquo;d I knaow!&rdquo; Alvira sharply responded. &ldquo;I got enough things to
      think of, &rsquo;thaout both&rsquo;rin&rsquo; my head abaout city women&rsquo;s dresses. &rsquo;N&rsquo;
      you ought to hev, tew. Ef you&rsquo;n&rsquo; Leander&rsquo;d pay more heed to yer
      work, &rsquo;n&rsquo; dew yer chores up ship-shape, &rsquo;n&rsquo; spen&rsquo; less time
      porin&rsquo; over them good-fer-nothin&rsquo; story-papers, th&rsquo; farm wouldn&rsquo;t look so
      run-daown &rsquo;n&rsquo; slaouchy. Did yeh hear what Albert said this mornin&rsquo;,
      when he looked &rsquo;raoun&rsquo;? &lsquo;I swan! &rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I b&rsquo;lieve this
      is th&rsquo; seediest lookin&rsquo; place &rsquo;n all Northern New York.&rsquo; Nice thing
      fer him to hev to say, wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What d&rsquo; I keer what <i>he</i> says? He ain&rsquo;t th&rsquo; boss here, by a
      jug-full!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;N&rsquo; more&rsquo;s th&rsquo; pity, tew. He&rsquo;d make yeh toe th&rsquo; mark!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, &rsquo;n&rsquo; Sabriny&rsquo;d make it lively fer his wife, tew. Th&rsquo; ole fight
      &rsquo;baout th&rsquo; Fairchileses &rsquo;n&rsquo; th&rsquo; Richardsons wouldn&rsquo;t be a
      succumstance to thet. Sissly&rsquo;d thank her stars thet she was dead &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      buried aout o&rsquo; th&rsquo; way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These two hired people, who discussed their employer and his family with
      that easy familiarity of Christian names to be found only in Russia and
      rural America, knew very well what portended to the house when the
      Richardson subject came up. Alvira Roberts had spent more than twenty
      years of her life in the thick of the gaseous strife between Fairchild and
      Richardson. She was a mere slip of a girl, barely thirteen, when she had
      first hired out at the homestead, and now, black-browed, sallow from much
      tea-drinking, and with a sharp, deep wrinkle vertically dividing her high
      forehead, she looked every year of her thirty-five. Compared with her,
      Milton Squires was a new comer on the farm, but still there were lean old
      cows over yonder in the barnyard, lazily waiting for the night-march to
      the pastures, that had been ravenous calves in their gruel-bucket stage
      when he came.
    </p>
    <p>
      What these two did not know about the Fairchild family was hardly worth
      the knowing. Something of what they knew, the reader ought here to be
      told.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.&mdash;THE STORY OF LEMUEL.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>emuel Fairchild,
      the bowed, gray-haired, lumpish man who at this time sat in the main
      living room within, feebly rocking himself by the huge wood-stove, and
      trying vaguely as he had been for thirty-six hours past, to realize that
      his wife lay in her final sleep in the adjoining chamber, had forty-odd
      years before been as likely a young farmer as Dearborn County knew. He was
      fine-looking and popular in those days, and old Seth Fairchild, dying
      unexpectedly, had left to this elder son his whole possessions&mdash;six
      hundred acres of dairy and hop land, free and clear, a residence much
      above the average farm-house of these parts, and a tidy sum of money in
      the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contrast now was sweeping. The Fairchild&rsquo;s house was still the largest
      residential structure on the Burfield road, which led from Thessaly across
      the hills to remote and barbarous latitudes, but respect had long since
      ceased to accrue to it upon the score of its size. To the local eye, it
      was the badge and synonym of &ldquo;rack and ruin;&rdquo; while sometimes strangers of
      artistic tastes, chancing to travel by this unfrequented road, would voice
      regrets that such a prospect as opened to the vision just here, with the
      noble range of hills behind for the first time looming in their true
      proportions, should be spoiled by such a gaunt, unsightly edifice, with
      its tumble-down surroundings, its staring windows cheaply curtained with
      green paper, and its cheerless, shabby color&mdash;that indescribable gray
      with which rain and frost and Father Time supplant unrenewed white. The
      garden, comprising a quarter-acre to the east of the house, was a tangled
      confusion of flowers and weeds and berry-bushes run wild, yet the effect
      somehow was mean rather than picturesque. The very grass in the yard to
      the west did not grow healthfully, but revealed patches of sandy
      barrenness, created by feet too indifferent or unruly to keep the path to
      the barns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the neighbors said, and Lemuel had come himself to feel, that the
      blame of this sad falling off was not fairly his. There had been a fatal
      defect in the legacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one needful thing which the Hon. Seth Fairchild did <i>not</i> leave
      his elder son was the brains by means of which he himself, in one way or
      another, had gathered together a substantial competency, won two elections
      to the State Senate, and established and held for himself the position of
      leading citizen in his town&mdash;that most valued and intangible of
      American local distinctions. But while Lemuel&rsquo;s brown hair curled so
      prettily, and his eyes shone with the modest light of wealthy and
      well-behaved youth, nobody missed the brains. If there was any change in
      the management of the farm, it passed unnoticed, for all attention was
      centred on the great problem, interesting enough always when means seeks a
      help-meet, but indescribably absorbing in rural communities, where
      everybody knows everybody and casual gallants never come for those
      luckless damsels neglected by native swains&mdash;Whom will he marry?
    </p>
    <p>
      It boots not now to recall the heart-burnings, the sad convictions that
      life would henceforth be a blank, the angry repinings at fate, which
      desolated the village of Thessaly and vicinity when Lemuel, returning from
      a mid-winter visit to Albany, brought a bride in the person of a bright
      eyed, handsome and clever young lady who had been Miss Cicely Richardson.
      He had known her, so they learned, for some years&mdash;not only during
      his school-days at the Academy there, but later, in what was mysteriously
      known in Thessaly as &ldquo;society,&rdquo; in whose giddy mazes he had mingled while
      on a visit to his legislative sire at the Capital City. No, it is not
      worth while to dwell upon the village hopes rudely destroyed by this shock&mdash;for
      they are dim memories of the far, far past.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to one the blow was a disappointment not to be forgotten, or to grow
      dim in recollection. Miss Sabrina Fairchild was two years younger than her
      brother in age&mdash;a score of years his senior in firmness and will. She
      had only a small jointure in her father&rsquo;s estate, because she had great
      expectations from an aunt in Ohio, in perpetual memory of whose
      anticipated bounty she bore her scriptural name, but she was a charge on
      her brother in that she was to have a home with him until she chose to
      leave it for one of her own. I doubt not that her sagacious father
      foresaw, from his knowledge of his daughter, the improbability that this
      second home would ever be offered her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Sabrina, even at this tender age, was clearly not of the marrying
      kind, and she grew less so with great steadiness. She was at this early
      date, when she was twenty-four, a woman of markedly strong character, of
      which perhaps the most distinct trait was family pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      There has been a considerable army of State Senators since New York first
      took on the honors of a Commonwealth, and unto them a great troop of
      daughters have been born, but surely no other of all these girls ever
      exulted so fondly, nay, fiercely, in the paternal dignity as did Sabrina.
      She knew nothing of politics, and little of the outside world; her
      conceptions of social possibilities were of the most primitive sort; one
      winter, when she went to Albany with her father, and was passed in a
      bewildered way through sundry experiences said to be of a highly
      fashionable nature, it had been temporarily apparent to her own
      consciousness that she was an awkward, ignorant, red-armed country-girl&mdash;but
      this only for one wretched hour or so. Every mile-post passed on her
      homeward ride, as she looked through the stage window, brought restored
      self-confidence, and long before the tedious journey ended she was more
      the Senator&rsquo;s daughter than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this very rebound from mortification she queened it over the
      simpler souls of the village with renewed severity and pomp. The itinerant
      singing master who thought to get her for the asking into his class in the
      school-house Wednesday evenings, was frozen by the amazed disdain of her
      refusal. When young Smith Thurber, the kiln-keeper&rsquo;s son, in the flippant
      spirit of fine buttons and a resplendent fob, asked her to dance a measure
      with him at the Wallaces&rsquo; party, the iciness of her stare fairly took away
      his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something can be guessed of her emotions when the brother brought home his
      bride. With a halfcowardly, half-kindly idea of postponing the trouble
      certain to ensue, he had given Sabrina no warning of his intention, and,
      through the slow mails of that date, only a day&rsquo;s advance notice of his
      return with Mrs. Lemuel. The storm did not burst at once. Indeed it may be
      said never to have really burst. Sabrina was not a bad woman, according to
      her lights, and she did nothing consciously to make her sister-in-law
      unhappy. The young wife had a light heart, a sensible mind and the faculty
      of being cheerful about many things which might be expected to annoy. But
      she had some pride, too, and although at the outset it was the very simple
      and praiseworthy pride of a well-meaning individual, incessant vaunting of
      the Fairchilds quite naturally gave a family twist to it, and she soon was
      able to resent slights in the name of all the Richardsons.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, was she not in the right? for while the grass was scarcely
      green on the grave of the first Fairchild who had amounted to anything,
      there were six generations of Richardsons in Albany chronicles alone who
      had married into the best Dutch families of that ancient, aristocratic
      town, to say nothing of the New England record antedating that period.
      Thus the case appeared to her, and came gradually to have more prominence
      in her mind than, in her maiden days, she could have thought possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      So this great Forty Years&rsquo; War began, in which there was to be no single
      grand, decisive engagement, but a thousand petty skirmishes and little
      raids, infinitely more vexatious and exhausting, and was waged until the
      weaker of the combatants, literally worn out in the fray, had laid down
      her arms and her life together, and was at peace at last, under the sheet
      in the darkened parlor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other veteran party to the feud, her thin, iron-gray hair half
      concealed under a black knit cap, her bold, sharp face red as with stains
      of tears, sat at the window of her own upper room, reading her Bible. If
      Milton and Alvira had known that she was reading in Judges, they might
      have been even more confident of a coming &ldquo;flare-up.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.&mdash;AUNT SABRINA.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>EIGHBORING
      philosophers who cared, from curiosity or a loftier motive, to study the
      Fairchild domestic problem, in all its social and historic ramifications,
      generally emerged from the inquiry with some personal bias against Miss
      Sabrina, tempered by the conclusion that, after all, there was a good deal
      to be said on the old lady&rsquo;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly, as the grim old maid in the rusty bombazine gown and cap, which
      gave a funereal air even to the red plaid shawl over her shoulders, sat at
      her upper window, and tried through a pained and resentful chaos of
      secular thoughts to follow the Scriptural lines, there was an extremely
      vivid conviction uppermost in her mind that justice had been meted out
      neither to her nor to the Fairchilds. She would have repelled indignantly,
      and honestly enough too, the charge that there was any bitterness in her
      heart toward the sister-in-law whose burial was appointed for the morrow.
      She had liked poor Cicely, in her iron-clad way, and had wept genuine
      tears more than once since her death. Indeed, her thoughts&mdash;and they
      were persistent, self-asserting thoughts which not even her favorite
      recital of Gideon&rsquo;s sanguinary triumph could keep back&mdash;ran more upon
      the living than upon the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what gloomy, melancholy thoughts they were! They swept over two score
      of years, the whole gamut of emotion, from the pride and hope of youth to
      the anguish of disappointed, wrathful, hopeless old age, as her hand might
      cover all there was of sound in music by a run down her mother&rsquo;s ancient
      spinet which stood, mute and forgotten, in the corner of the room. Her
      brother, this brother whom satirical fate had made a Lemuel instead of a
      Lucy or a Lucretia, a man instead of a woman as befitted his weakness of
      mind and spirit&mdash;had begun life with a noble heritage. Where was it
      now? He had been the heir to a leading position among the men of his
      county. What was he now? The Fairchilds had been as rich, as respected, as
      influential as any Dearborn family. Who did them honor now?
    </p>
    <p>
      The mental answers to these questions blurred Miss Sabrina&rsquo;s spectacles
      with tears, and Gideon&rsquo;s performance with the lamps seemed a tiresome
      thing. She laid the Book aside, and went softly down stairs to her
      brother, who sat, still rocking in his late wife&rsquo;s high, cushioned
      arm-chair, disconsolate by the stove.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were also in the room his oldest son and this son&rsquo;s wife, sitting
      dumbly, each at a window, making a seemly pretence of not being bored by
      the meagre prospect without. They looked at their aunt in that far-off
      impassive manner with which participants in a high pageant or solemn
      observance always regard one another. There was no call for a greeting,
      since they had already exchanged whispered salutations, earlier in the
      day. Miss Sabrina glanced at the young wife for an instant&mdash;it was
      not a kindly glance. Then her eyes turned to the husband, and while
      surveying him seemed suddenly to light up with some new thought. She
      almost smiled, and her tight pressed lips parted. Had they followed the
      prompting of the brain and spoken, the words would have been:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God, there is still Albert!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert Fairchild would have been known in any company, and in any guise, I
      think, for a lawyer. The profession had its badge in every line and aspect
      of his face, in every movement of his head, and, so it seemed, in the way
      he held his hands, in the very tone of his voice. His face was round, and
      would have been pleasant, so far as conformation and expression went, had
      it not been for the eyes, which were unsympathetic, almost cold. Often the
      rest of his countenance was wreathed in amiable smiles; but the eyes
      smiled never. He had looked a middle-aged man for a decade back, and
      casual acquaintances who met him from year to year complimented him on not
      growing old, because they saw no change. In fact he had been old from the
      beginning, and even now looked more than his age, which lacked some few
      months of forty. He was growing bald above the temples, and, like all the
      Fairchilds, was taking on flesh with increasing years. Nothing could have
      better shown the extremity of poor Sabrina&rsquo;s woe than this clutching at
      the relief afforded by the sight of Albert, for she was not on good terms
      with him. Albert had been born and reared through boyhood at a time when
      the farm was still prosperous and money plenty. He had been educated far
      beyond the traditions of his sires, and was the first University man of
      his family, so far as was known. He had been given his own bent in all
      things, before he settled down to a choice of profession, and then, at
      considerable expense, had been secured a place with one of the greatest
      legal firms in New York City. For years the first fruits of the soil, the
      cream off all the milk&mdash;so the Aunt&rsquo;s mingled scriptural and dairy
      metaphors ran&mdash;had been his. And what return had they had for it? He
      had become a sound, successful lawyer, with a handsome income, and he had
      married wealth as well. Yet year after year, as the fortunes of the
      Fairchild homestead declined, he had never interfered to prevent the fresh
      mortgage being placed&mdash;nay, had more than once explicitly declined to
      help save it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agriculture is out of date in this State,&rdquo; she had heard him say once,
      with her own ears, &ldquo;Better let the old people live on their capital, as
      they go along. It&rsquo;s no use throwing good money after bad. Farm land here
      in the East is bound to decrease in value, steadily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This about the homestead&mdash;about the cradle of his ancestors! Poor old
      lady, had the Fairchilds been sending baronial roots down through all this
      soil for a thousand years, she couldn&rsquo;t have been more pained or mortified
      over Albert&rsquo;s callous view of the farm which her grandfather, a revolted
      cobbler from Rhode Island, had cleared and paid for at ten cents an acre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was his marriage, too. In all the years of armed neutrality or
      tacit warfare which she and Cicely had passed together under one roof,
      they had never before or since come so near an open and palpable rupture
      as they did over a city-bred cousin of Cicely&rsquo;s&mdash;a forward,
      impertinent, ill-behaved girl from New York, who had come to the farm on a
      visit some ten years before, and whose father was summoned at last to take
      her away because otherwise she, Sabrina, threatened to herself leave the
      house. There had been a desperate scene before this conclusion was
      reached. Sabrina had stormed and threatened to shake the dust of the
      homestead from off her outraged sandals. Cicely for the once had stood her
      ground, and said she fancied even worse things than that might happen
      without producing a universal cataclysm. Lemuel had almost wept with
      despair over the tumult. The two older boys, particularly John, had not
      concealed their exuberant hope that their maiden Aunt might be taken at
      her word, and allowed to leave. And the girl herself, this impudent huzzy
      of a Richardson, actually put her spoke in too, and said things about old
      cats and false teeth, which it made Sabrina&rsquo;s blood still boil to recall.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was this girl, of all others in the world, whom Albert must go and
      marry!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Sabrina, in her present despondent mood, felt herself able to rise
      above mere personal piques and dislikes, if there really was a hope for
      the family&rsquo;s revival. She was not very sanguine about even Albert, but
      beyond him there was no chance at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      John, the second brother, had talent enough, she supposed. People said he
      was smart, and he must be, else he could scarcely have come in his
      twenty-eighth year to be owner and editor of the Thessaly <i>Banner of
      Liberty</i>, and put in all those political pieces written in the first
      person plural, as if he had the power of attorney for all Dearborn county.
      But then he was mortally shiftless about money matters, and they did say
      that since his wife&rsquo;s death&mdash;a mere school-teacher she had been&mdash;he
      had become quite dissipated and played billiards. Besides she was at open
      feud with him, and never, never would speak to him again, the longest day
      <i>he</i> lived! So that settled John.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Seth, the youngest of the brothers, it is to be doubted if she
      would have thought of him at all, had he not come in at the moment. He had
      been down to the village to get some black clothes which the tailor had
      constructed on short notice for him, and he, too, passed through the
      sitting room to the stairs with the serious look and the dead silence
      which the awful presence imposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she did think of him for a moment, as she stood warming her fingers
      over the bald, flat top of the stove&mdash;for though bright and warm
      enough outside, the air was still chilly in these great barns of rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seth was indisputably the handsomest of all the Fairchilds, even handsomer
      than she remembered his father to have been&mdash;a tall, straight,
      broadshouldered youth, who held his head well up and looked everybody in
      the face with honest hazel eyes. He had the Richardson complexion, a dusky
      tint gained doubtless from all those Dutch intermarriages of which poor
      Cicely used to make so much, but his brown hair curled much as Lemuel&rsquo;s
      used to curl, only not so effeminately, and his temper was as even as his
      father&rsquo;s had been, though not so submissive or weak. His hands were rough
      and coarse from the farm work, and his walk showed familiarity with
      ploughed ground, but still he had, in his way, a more distinguished air
      than either Albert or John had ever had.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking him over, a stranger would have been surprised that his aunt
      should have left him out of her thoughts of the family&rsquo;s future&mdash;or
      that, once pausing to consider him, she should have dropped the idea so
      swiftly. But so it was. Miss Sabrina felt cold and aggrieved toward
      Albert, and she came as near hating John as a deeply devout woman safely
      could. She simply took no account of Seth at all, as she would have
      expressed it. To her he was a quiet, harmless sort of youngster, who
      worked prettily steadily on the farm, and got on civilly with people. She
      understood that he was very fond of reading, but that made no special
      impression on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she had been asked, she would undoubtedly have said that Seth was her
      favorite nephew&mdash;but she had never dreamed of regarding him as a
      possible restorer of the family glories.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is yer oven hot enough?&rdquo; she asked Alvira in the kitchen, a minute later.
      &ldquo;If they&rsquo;s anything I <i>dew</i> hate, it&rsquo;s a soggy undercrust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I kin manage a batch o&rsquo; pies by this time,&rdquo; returned the
      hired-girl with a sniff. Through some unexplained process of reasoning,
      Alvira was with the Fairchilds as against the Richardsons, but she was
      first of all for herself, against the whole human race.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Milton gone aout with the caows?&rdquo; asked the old lady, ignoring for the
      once the domestic&rsquo;s challenge. &ldquo;When he comes back, he &rsquo;n&rsquo; Leander
      better go over to Wilkinses, and get what chairs they kin spare. I s&rsquo;pose
      there&rsquo;ll be a big craowd, ef only to git in and see if there&rsquo;s any holes
      in our body-Brussels yit, &rsquo;n&rsquo; haow that sofy-backed set in the
      parlor&rsquo;s holdin&rsquo; out. Poor Cicely! I think they better bring over the
      chairs tonight, after dusk. What people don&rsquo;t see they can&rsquo;t talk abaout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heard Milton say he was goin&rsquo; to borrer some over at Warren&rsquo;s,&rdquo; remarked
      Alvira, in a casual way, but looking around to see how the idea affected
      Miss Sabrina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well he jis&rsquo; won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; came the answer, very promptly and spiritedly. &ldquo;If
      every mortal soul of &rsquo;em hes to stan&rsquo; up, he won&rsquo;t! I guess Lemuel
      Fairchild&rsquo;s wife can be buried &rsquo;thaout asking any help from Matildy
      Warren. I wouldn&rsquo;t ask her if &rsquo;twas th&rsquo; las&rsquo; thing I ever did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Annie sent word she was comin&rsquo; over fus&rsquo; thing in th&rsquo; mornin&rsquo;, so&rsquo;s
      to help clear up th&rsquo; breakfast things. If she&rsquo;s good enough fer that, I
      don&rsquo;t see why you need be afeered o&rsquo; borryin&rsquo; her chairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They ain&rsquo;t her chairs, and you knaow it, Alviry. I ain&rsquo;t got a word to
      say agin&rsquo; Annie Fairchild, but when it comes to her gran&rsquo; mother, I kin
      ride a high horse as well&rsquo;s she kin. After all the trouble she made my
      family, the sight of a single stick of her furnitur&rsquo; here&rsquo;d be enough to
      bring the rafters of this haouse daown over my head, I do believe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of course, &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t none o&rsquo; my business, but seems to me there&rsquo;ll be
      a plaguey slim fun&rsquo;r&rsquo;l when <i>your</i> turn comes if you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to keep
      up all these old-woman&rsquo;s fights with everybody &rsquo;raound abaout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naow Alviry!&rdquo; began Miss Sabrina, in her shrillest and angriest tone;
      then with a visible effort, as if remembering something, she paused and
      then went on in a subdued, almost submissive voice, &ldquo;You knaow jis&rsquo; haow
      Matildy Warren&rsquo;s used us. From the very day my poor brother William ran
      off with her Jenny&mdash;and goodness knaows whatever possessed him to dew
      it&mdash;thet old woman&rsquo;s never missed a chance to run us all daown&mdash;ez
      ef she oughtn&rsquo;t to been praoud o&rsquo; th&rsquo; day a Fairchild took up with a
      Warren.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess you ain&rsquo;t had none the wu&rsquo;st of it,&rdquo; put in Alvira, with sarcasm.
      &ldquo;Guess your tongue&rsquo;s &rsquo;baout as sharp as her&rsquo;n ever was. B&rsquo;sides
      she&rsquo;s bed-ridden naow, &rsquo;n&rsquo; everybody thought she wouldn&rsquo;t get threw
      th&rsquo; spring. &rsquo;N&rsquo; ef Seth&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to make up to Annie, you ought to
      begin to smooth things over &rsquo;fore she dies. There&rsquo;s no tellin&rsquo; but
      what she mightn&rsquo;t leave the farm away f&rsquo;m th&rsquo; girl at th&rsquo; last minute,
      jis&rsquo; to spite you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yeh needn&rsquo;t talk as if <i>I</i> wanted her pesky farm!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well now, you knaow what I mean&rsquo;s well&rsquo;s I dew. What&rsquo;s th&rsquo; use o&rsquo;
      harpin&rsquo; on what yer brother William did, or what ole Matildy said, &rsquo;fore
      I was born, when you knaow th&rsquo; tew farms jine, and yer heart&rsquo;s sot on
      havin&rsquo; &rsquo;em in one&mdash;Yes, &rsquo;fore I was born,&rdquo; repeated the
      domestic, as if pleased with the implication of juvenility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Sabrina hesitated, and looked at Alvira meditatively through her
      spectacles, in momentary doubt about the propriety of saying a sharp thing
      under all the circumstances; but the temptation was not to be resisted. &ldquo;&rsquo;N&rsquo;
      you ain&rsquo;t percisely a chicken yourself, Alviry,&rdquo; she said and left the
      kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, when Milton had returned from the pasture, and hung about the
      kitchen, mending the harness that went with the democrat-wagon while
      waiting for Leander to return from the cheese factory, Alvira remarked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems &rsquo;if Sabriny&rsquo;d lost all her sper&rsquo;t this last day or tew.
      Never see sech a change. She don&rsquo;t answer up wuth a cent. I shouldn&rsquo;t be
      s&rsquo;prised if she didn&rsquo;t tackle Albert&rsquo;s wife after all. Oh yes, &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      you ain&rsquo;t to go to Warren&rsquo;s for them chairs. Sa-briny&rsquo;s dead-set agin
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; asked Milton, &ldquo;Hez Seth broke off with Annie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t knaow&rsquo;s they ever was anything particular to break off. No, &rsquo;t
      &rsquo;aint that; it&rsquo;s the same raow &lsquo;tween the two ole women. Goodness
      knaows, I&rsquo;m sick &rsquo;n&rsquo; tired of hearin&rsquo; &rsquo;baout it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but ain&rsquo;t Seth &rsquo;n&rsquo; Annie fixed it up?&rdquo; persisted Milton;
      &ldquo;Daown&rsquo;t th&rsquo; corners they say it&rsquo;s all settled.&rdquo; Then he mutteringly
      added, as he slouched out to meet Leander, who drove up now with a great
      rattle of empty milk-cans. &ldquo;I wish&rsquo;t <i>I</i> was in Seth&rsquo;s shoes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you <i>dew</i>, dew yeh!&rdquo; said Alvira, thus left to herself.

      CHAPTER IV.&mdash;THE TWO YOUNG WOMEN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he young girl
      whose future had been settled down at the corners, came along the road
      next morning toward the Fairchild house, all unconscious of her destiny.
      She lived in a small, old-fashioned farm-dwelling back in the fields,
      alone with her grandmother, and although there was a bitter feud between
      the heads of the two houses, it had not stopped her from being a familiar
      and helpful figure in her uncle&rsquo;s homestead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annie Fairchild was a country girl in some senses of the term, calm-faced,
      clear-eyed, self-reliant among her friends, but with a curious disposition
      toward timidity in the presence of strangers. She was held to be too
      serious and &ldquo;school-ma&rsquo;am-ish&rdquo; for pleasant company by most rural maidens
      of her acquaintance, and the few attempts of young farmers of the
      country-side to establish friendly relations with her had not been crowned
      with conspicuous success. It could scarcely be said that she was haughty
      or cold; no one could demonstrate in detail that her term of schooling in
      a far-off citified seminary had made her proud or uncivil; but still she
      had no intimates.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the more marked from the fact that she was a pretty girl&mdash;or
      if not precisely pretty, very attractive and winning in face. No other
      girl of the neighborhood had so fine and regular a profile, or such
      expressive, dark eyes, or so serenely intelligent an expression. It had
      been whispered at one time that Reuben Tracy, the school-master, was
      likely to make a match of it with her, but this had faded away again as a
      rootless rumor; by this time everybody on the Burfield road tacitly
      understood that eventually she was to be the wife of her cousin Seth, when
      it &ldquo;came time for the two farms to join.&rdquo; And she had grown accustomed
      long since to the furtive, half-awed, half-covetous look which men cast
      upon her, without suspecting the spirit of reluctant renunciation
      underlying it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She met Milton Squires on the road, close in front of the Fairchild&rsquo;s
      house, this morning, and, nodding to him, passed on. She did not
      particularly note the gaze he bent upon her as she went by, and which
      followed her afterward, almost to the Fairchild gate. If she had done so,
      and could have read all its meaning, she would not have gone on with so
      unruffled a face, for it was a look to frighten an honest young woman&mdash;an
      intent, hungry, almost wolfish look, unrelieved by so much as a glimmer of
      the light of manliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she was alike unconscious of his thoughts and of the gossip he had
      heard at the corners. Certainly no listener who followed her to the gate,
      where she encountered Seth at work screwing on a new hinge, would have
      gathered from the tone or words of the greeting on either side any
      testimony to confirm the common supposition that they were destined for
      each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Seth,&rdquo; she said, halting while he dragged the great gate
      open for her, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re all through breakfast, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I think Albert and his wife are at the table still. We didn&rsquo;t call
      them when the rest got up, you know. They&rsquo;re not used to country ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anybody else here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, except John.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad he came. That Lize Wilkins has been telling everybody he
      wouldn&rsquo;t come on Sabrina&rsquo;s account. And it would have looked <i>so</i>
      bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Lize Wilkins talks too much. All John ever said was that he wouldn&rsquo;t
      stay here in the house any more than he could help. It&rsquo;s too bad he can&rsquo;t
      get along better with Aunt; it would make things so much pleasanter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s your father, Seth? He seemed at first to take it pretty hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He appeared a little brighter yesterday, after Albert came, but he&rsquo;s very
      poorly this morning. Poor old man, it makes a sad difference with him&mdash;more
      I suppose than with us boys, even with me, who never have been away from
      her hardly for a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Seth, a boy outgrows his mother, I suppose, but for an old couple
      who have lived together forty years a separation like this must be awful.
      I shall go up to the house now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth followed her with his eyes as she walked up the road, past the
      old-fashioned latticed front door with its heavy fold of crape hanging on
      the knocker, and turned from sight at the corner of the house; and the
      look in his face was soft and admiring, even if it was hardly loverlike.
      In his trouble&mdash;and he felt the bereavement most keenly&mdash;it
      seemed restful and good to have such a girl as Annie about, Indeed, a
      vague thought that she had never before seemed so sweet and likeable came
      to him, as he turned again to the hinge, and lightened his heart
      perceptibly, for almost the last words his mother had spoken to him had
      been of his future with Annie as his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have the farm before long, Seth,&rdquo; she said, smiling faintly as
      he stroked her pale hair&mdash;somehow to the last it never grew grey&mdash;and
      looked at her through boyish tears, &ldquo;and Annie will bring you the Warren
      farm. Her grandmother and I have talked it over many a time. Annie&rsquo;s a
      good girl, there&rsquo;s no better, and she&rsquo;ll make my boy a good, true wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a year or two back Seth had understood in a nebulous way that his
      parents had an idea of his eventually marrying Annie, but his mother&rsquo;s
      words still came to him in the form of a surprise. First, it had been far
      from his thoughts that old Mrs. Warren, Annie&rsquo;s invalid grandmother, would
      listen to such a thing, much less plan it. There was a bitterness of long
      standing between the two families, he knew. His father&rsquo;s younger brother&mdash;a
      halfbrother&mdash;named William Fairchild, had married Mrs. Warren&rsquo;s only
      daughter under circumstances which he had never heard detailed, but which
      at least had enraged the mother. Both William and his wife had died, out
      West he believed, years and years ago, leaving only this girl, Annie
      Fairchild, who came an orphan to the grandmother she had never seen
      before, and was reared by her. In this Mrs. Warren and his aunt Sabrina
      had found sufficient occasion for a quarrel, lasting ever since he could
      remember, and as he had always understood from his aunt that her battle
      was in defense of the whole family, he had taken it for granted that he
      not less than the other Fairchilds was included in Mrs. Warren&rsquo;s disfavor.
      He recalled, now, indeed, having heard Annie say once or twice that her
      grandmother liked him; but this he had taken in a negative way, as if the
      grandmother of the Capulets had remarked that of all the loathed Montagus
      perhaps young Romeo was personally the least offensive to her sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      And second, he was far from being in a Romeo&rsquo;s condition of heart and
      mind. He was not in love with Annie for herself&mdash;much less for the
      Warren farm. To state plainly what Seth had not yet mustered courage to
      say in entire frankness even to himself, he hated farming, and rebelled
      against the idea of following in his father&rsquo;s footsteps. And the dreams of
      a career elsewhere which occupied the mutinous thoughts Seth concealed
      under so passive an exterior had carried him far away from the plan of an
      alliance with the nice sort of country cousin who would eventually own the
      adjoining farm. So in this sense, too, his mothers dying words were a
      surprise&mdash;converting into a definite and almost sacred desire what he
      had supposed to be merely a shapeless fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not all this crossed his mind, as he watched Annie till she disappeared,
      and then turned back to his work. But the sight of her had been pleasant
      to him, and her voice had sounded very gentle and yet full of the
      substance of womanliness&mdash;and perhaps his poor, dear mother&rsquo;s plan
      for him, after all, was the best.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gate swinging properly at last, there was an end to Seth&rsquo;s out-door
      tasks, and he started toward the house. The thought that he would see
      Annie within was distinct enough in his mind, almost, to constitute a
      motive for his going. At the very door he encountered his brother Albert&rsquo;s
      wife, coming out, and stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isabel Fairchild was far from deserving, at least as a woman, the epithets
      with which Aunt Sabrina mentally coupled her girlhood. There was nothing
      impertinent or ill-behaved about her appearance, certainly, as she stood
      before Seth, and with a faint smile bade him good-morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was above the medium height, as woman&rsquo;s stature goes, and almost
      plump; her hair, much of which was shown in front by the pretty Parisian
      form of straw hat she wore, was very light in color; her eyes were blue, a
      light, noticeable blue. She wore some loose kind of black and gray morning
      dress, with an extra fold falling in graceful lines from her shoulders to
      her train, like a toga, and she carried a dainty parasol, also of black
      and gray, like the ribbons on her dark hat. To Seth&rsquo;s eyes she had seemed
      yesterday, when he saw her for the first time, a very embodiment of the
      luxury, beauty, refinement of city life&mdash;and how much more so now,
      when her dingy traveling raiment had given place to this most engaging
      garb, so subdued, yet so lovely. It seemed to him that his sister-in-law
      was quite the most attractive woman he had ever seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought of going for a little stroll,&rdquo; she said, again with the faint,
      half-smile. &ldquo;It is so charming outside, and so blue and depressing in the
      house. Can I walk along there through the orchard now?&mdash;I used to
      when I was here as a girl, I know&mdash;and won&rsquo;t you come with me? I&rsquo;ve
      scarcely had a chance for a word with you since we came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The invitation was pleasant enough to Seth, but he looked down
      deprecatingly at his rough chore clothes, and wondered whether he ought to
      accept it or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Seth, the <i>idea</i> of standing on ceremony with <i>me!</i> As if
      we hadn&rsquo;t played together here as children&mdash;to say nothing of my
      being your sister now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had started now toward the orchard, and she continued:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, it seems as if I didn&rsquo;t know anybody here but you&mdash;and
      even you almost make a stranger out of me. Poor Uncle Lemuel, he is so
      broken-down that he scarcely remembers me, and of course your Aunt and I
      couldn&rsquo;t be expected to get very intimate&mdash;you remember our dispute?
      Then John, he&rsquo;s very pleasant, and all that, but he isn&rsquo;t at all like the
      John I used to look up to so, the summer I was here. But you&mdash;you
      have hardly changed a bit. Of course,&rdquo; she made haste to add, for Seth&rsquo;s
      face did not reflect unalloyed gratification at this, &ldquo;you have grown
      manly and big, and all that, but you haven&rsquo;t changed in your expression or
      manner. It&rsquo;s almost ten years&mdash;and I should have known you anywhere.
      But John <i>has</i> changed&mdash;he&rsquo;s more like a city man, or rather a
      villager, a compromise between city and country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m a countryman through and through, I suppose,&rdquo; said Seth, with
      something very like a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John has seen a good deal of the world they tell me, and been on papers
      in large cities. I wonder how he can content himself with that little
      weekly in Thessaly after that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think John has much ambition,&rdquo; answered Seth, meditatively. &ldquo;He
      doesn&rsquo;t seem to care much how things go, if he only has the chance to say
      what he wants to say in print. It doesn&rsquo;t make any difference to him,
      apparently, whether all New York State reads what he writes, or only
      thirty or forty fellows in Dearborn County&mdash;he&rsquo;s just as well
      satisfied. And yet he&rsquo;s a very bright man, too. He might have gone to the
      Assembly last fall, if he could have bid against Elhanan Pratt. He <i>will</i>
      go sometime, probably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, do you have an auction here for the Assembly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, but the man who&rsquo;s willing to pay a big assessment into the
      campaign fund can generally shut a poor candidate out John didn&rsquo;t seem to
      mind much about being frozen out though&mdash;not half so much as I did,
      for him. Everybody in Thessaly knows him and likes him and calls him
      &lsquo;John,&rsquo; and that seems to be the height of his ambition. I can&rsquo;t imagine a
      man of his abilities being satisfied with so limited a horizon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, you, Seth, what is your horizon like?&rdquo; asked Isabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had entered the orchard path, now, and the apple blossoms close above
      them filled the May morning air with that sweet spring perfume which seems
      to tell of growth, harvest, the fruition of hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m picked out to be a countryman all the days of my life I suppose.&rdquo;
       There was the sigh again, and a tinge of bitterness in his tone, as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I hope not&mdash;that is, if you don&rsquo;t want to be. Oh, it must be
      such a dreary life! The very thought of it sets my teeth on edge. The
      dreadful people you have to know: men without an idea beyond crops and
      calves and the cheese-factory; women slaving their lives out doing bad
      cooking, mending for a houseful of men, devoting their scarce
      opportunities for intercourse with other women to the weakest and most
      wretched gossip; coarse servants who eat at the table with their employers
      and call them by their Christian names; boys whose only theory about
      education is thrashing the school teacher, if it is a man, or breaking her
      heart by their mean insolence if it is a woman; and girls brought up to be
      awkward gawks, without a chance in life, since the brighter and nicer they
      are the more they will suffer from marriage with men mentally beneath them&mdash;that
      is, if they don&rsquo;t become sour old maids. I don&rsquo;t wonder you hate it all,
      Seth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk like a book,&rdquo; said Seth, in tones of unmistakable admiration. &ldquo;I
      didn&rsquo;t suppose any woman could talk like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I talk as I feel always, when I come into contact with country life, and
      I get, angry with people who maunder about its romantic and picturesque
      side. Where is it, I should, like to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it isn&rsquo;t all so bad as you paint it, perhaps, Isabel. Of course&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;&mdash;here
      he hesitated a little&mdash;&ldquo;you don&rsquo;t quife see it at its best here, you
      know. Father hasn&rsquo;t been a first-rate manager, and things have kin all so
      bad as you paint it, perhaps, Isabel. Of course&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; here he
      hesitated a little&mdash;&ldquo;you don&rsquo;t quife see it at its best here, you
      know. Father hasn&rsquo;t been a first-rate manager, and things have kind o&rsquo; run
      down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Seth, it isn&rsquo;t that; the trail of the serpent is over it all&mdash;rich
      and poor, big and little. The Nineteenth century is a century of cities;
      they have given their own twist to the progress of the age&mdash;and the
      farmer is almost as far out of it as if he lived in Alaska. Perhaps there
      may have been a time when a man could live in what the poet calls daily
      communion with Nature and not starve his mind and dwarf his soul, but this
      isn&rsquo;t the century.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Webster was a farm boy, and so was Lincoln and Garfield and Jackson&mdash;almost
      all our great men. Hardly any of them are born in cities, you will find.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the country is just splendid to be born in, no doubt of that; but
      after you are born, get out of it as soon as you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as I can leave Father very well,&rdquo; said Seth slowly, and as
      if in deep thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked to the end of the pasture beyond the orchard, to within view
      of the spot where all the Fairchilds for three generations had been laid,
      and where, among the clustering sweet-briars and wild-strawberry vines
      Milton had only yesterday dug a new grave. The sight recalled to both
      another subject, and no more was said of country life as they returned to
      the house. Indeed, little was said of any sort, for Seth had a thinking
      mood on. Nothing was very clear in his mind perhaps, but more distinctly
      than anything else he felt that existence on the farm had all at once
      become intolerable.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.&mdash;THE FUNERAL.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he American
      farm-house funeral is surely, of all the observances with which civilized
      man marks the ending of this earthly pilgrimage, the most pathetic. The
      rural life itself is a sad and sterile enough thing, with its unrelieved
      physical strain, its enervating and destructive diet, its mental
      barrenness, its sternly narrowed groove of toil and thought and
      companionship&mdash;but death on the farm brings a desolating gloom, a
      cruel sense of the hopelessness of existence, which one realizes nowhere
      else. The grim, fatalist habit of seizing upon the grotesque side, which a
      century of farm life has crystallized into what the world knows as
      American humor, is not wanting even in this hour; and the comforting
      conviction of immortality, of the shining reward to follow travail and
      sorrow, is nowhere more firmly insisted upon than among our country
      people. But the bleak environment of the closed life, the absence of real
      fellowship among the living, the melancholy isolation and vanity of it
      all, oppress the soul here with an intolerable weight which neither fund
      of sardonic spirits nor honest faith can lighten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something of this Isabel felt, as the mid-day meal was hurried through, on
      Alvira&rsquo;s sharp intimation that the room couldn&rsquo;t be cleared any too soon,
      for the crowd would begin coming now, right along. There were three
      strangers at the table&mdash;though they seemed to be scarcely more
      strangers than the members of her husband&rsquo;s family&mdash;of whom two were
      clergymen.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of these, who sat next to her, was the Episcopalian minister at
      Thessaly, a middle-aged, soft sort of man, with short hair so smooth and
      furry that she was conscious of an impulse to stroke it like a seal-skin,
      and little side-whiskers which reminded her of a baby brush. He impressed
      her as a stupid man, but in that she was mistaken. He was nervous and ill
      at ease, first because he could not successfully or gracefully use the
      narrow three-tined steel fork with a bone handle that had been given him,
      and second, because he did not understand the presence of the Rev. Stephen
      Bunce, who sat opposite him, offensively smacking his lips, and devoting
      to loud discourse periods which it seemed might better have been employed
      in mastication.
    </p>
    <p>
      If quiet Mr. Turner was ill at ease, the Rev. Stephen was certainly not.
      He bestrode the situation like a modern Colossus. The shape of his fork
      did not worry him, since he used it only as a humble and lowly adjunct to
      his knife. The presence of Mr. Turner too, neither puzzled nor pained him.
      In fact, he was rather pleased than otherwise to have him there, where he
      could talk to him before sympathetic witnesses, and make him realise how
      the man of the people who had a genuine call towered innately superior to
      mere beneficed gentility. &ldquo;Beneficed gentility&rdquo;&mdash;that was a good
      phrase, and he made a mental note of it for future use; then&mdash;the
      temptation was too strong&mdash;he bundled it neck and crop into the
      florid sentence with which he was addressing Albert&mdash;and looked at
      the Episcopalian to watch its effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Turner was occupied with his javelin-shaped fork, and did not seem to
      hear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bunce suspected artifice in this, and watched the rector&rsquo;s meek face
      for a sign of secret confusion. After a moment he said, with his full,
      pompous voice at its loudest and most artificial pitch:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Mr. Turner, this is a sad occasion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rector glanced up with some surprise, for he had not expected this
      overture, and answered &ldquo;Yes, truly it is; extremely sad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet it is consoling to feel that even so sad an occasion can be converted
      into a means of grace, a season of spiritual solace as it were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Turner only nodded assent to this; he felt that the whole company
      around the table, hired people and all, were eagerly watching him and the
      burly, bold-faced preacher opposite, as if they were about to engage in
      gladiatorial combat.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Bunce would not permit the challenge to be declined. He stroked
      his ochre-hued chin whisker, looked complacently around the board, and
      asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose you&rsquo;ve brought your white and black riggins&rsquo; along, eh? Or don&rsquo;t
      you wear &rsquo;em except in Church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pained look in Mr. Turner&rsquo;s face; he made a little gesture
      toward the folding doors leading to the parlor, beyond which lay the dead,
      and murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be better, will it not, to speak of these matters together, after
      dinner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the Rev. Stephen glanced around the table, looking especially toward
      Miss Sabrina for approval, and remarked loftily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no need of concealment here, sir. It is all in the family here.
      We all know that the Mother in Israel who has departed was formerly of
      your communion, and if she wanted to have you here, sir, at her funeral,
      why well and good. But the rest of this sorrowin&rsquo; family, sir, this
      stricken household, air Baptists&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare! there&rsquo;s the Burrells drivin&rsquo; into the yard, a&rsquo;ready!&rdquo; said
      Alvira, rising from her chair abruptly. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re threw we better hustle
      these things aout, naow; you women won&rsquo;t more&rsquo;n have time to dress &rsquo;fore
      they&rsquo;ll all be here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The interruption seemed a welcome one to everybody, for there was a
      general movement on both sides of Mr. Bunce, which he, with his sentence
      unfinished, was constrained to join.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third stranger, a small, elderly man with a mobile countenance and
      rusty black clothes, drew himself up, put on a modifiedly doleful
      expression, and, speaking for the first time, assumed control of
      everything:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naow, Milton, you &rsquo;n&rsquo; Leander git the table aout, &rsquo;n&rsquo; bring
      in all the extry chairs, &rsquo;n&rsquo; set &rsquo;em &rsquo;raound in rows.
      Squeeze &rsquo;em pooty well together in back, but the front ones kind o&rsquo;
      spread aout. You, Miss Sabriny, &rsquo;n&rsquo; the lady&rdquo;&mdash;indicating
      Isabel with his thumb&mdash;&ldquo;&rsquo;n&rsquo; Annie&rsquo;d better go upstairs &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      git yer bonnets on, &rsquo;n&rsquo; things, &rsquo;n&rsquo; go &rsquo;n&rsquo; set in the
      room at the head o&rsquo; the stairs. You men, tew, git your gloves on, &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      naow be sure &rsquo;n&rsquo; have your hankch&rsquo;fs in some pocket where you can
      git at &rsquo;em with your gloves on&mdash;&rsquo;n&rsquo; have your hats in
      your hands, &lsquo;n&rsquo; then go &rsquo;n&rsquo; set with the ladies. Miss Sabriny,
      you&rsquo;ll come daown arm-in-arm with yer brother, <i>when</i> I call, &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      then Albert &rsquo;n&rsquo; his wife, &rsquo;n&rsquo; John with Annie, &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      Seth with&mdash;pshaw, there&rsquo;s odd numbers. Well, Seth can come alone. And
      dew keep step comin&rsquo; daown stairs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;N&rsquo; naow, gents,&rdquo; turning to the Rev. Mr. Turner, &ldquo;your gaown&rsquo;s in
      the fust room to the right on the landin&rsquo;, and if you&rdquo;&mdash;addressing
      Mr. Bunce&mdash;&ldquo;will go up with him, and arrange &rsquo;baout the
      services, so&rsquo;s to come daown together&mdash;it&rsquo;ll look pootier than to
      straggle in by yourselves,&mdash;&rsquo;n&rsquo; you, Milton, ain&rsquo;t you got
      somethin&rsquo; besides overalls to put on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus the autocrat cleared the living room. Then, going around through the
      front hall, he entered the parlor to receive, with solemn dignity and a
      fine eye to their relative social merit, the first comers.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were almost exclusively women, dressed in Sunday garb. As each buggy
      or democrat wagon drove up inside the gate, and discharged its burden, the
      men would lead the horses further on, to be hitched under or near the
      shed, and then saunter around to the kitchen side of the house, where
      cider was on tap, and other men were standing in the sunshine, chewing
      tobacco and conversing in low tones, while the women from each conveyance
      went straight to the front door, and got seats in the parlor as close to
      the coffin as possible. The separation of the sexes could hardly have been
      more rigorous in a synagogue. There were, indeed two or three meek,
      well-brushed men among the women, sitting, uncomfortable but resigned, in
      the geranium-scented gloom of the curtained parlor, but, as the more
      virile brethren outside would have said, they were men who didn&rsquo;t count.
    </p>
    <p>
      The task of the undertaker was neither light nor altogether smooth. There
      were some dozen chairs reserved, nearest the pall, for the mourners, the
      clergymen and the mixed quartette expected from Thessaly. Every woman on
      entering made for these chairs, and the more unimportant and &ldquo;low-down&rdquo;
       she was in the rural scale of social values, the more confidently she
      essayed to get one of them. With all of these more or less argument was
      necessary&mdash;conducted in a buzzing whisper from which some squeak or
      guttural exclamation would now and again emerge. With some, the undertaker
      was compelled to be quite peremptory; while one woman&mdash;Susan Jane
      Squires, a slatternly, weak-eyed creature who presumed upon her position
      as sister-in-law of Milton, the hired man&mdash;had actually to be pushed
      away by sheer force.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was the further labor of inducing all these disappointed ones
      to take the seats furthest back, so that late comers might not have to
      push by and over them, but efforts in this direction were only fitful at
      the best, and soon were practically abandoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fust come, fust sarved!&rdquo; said old Mrs. Wimple. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m jes ez good ez them
      that&rsquo;ll come bimeby, &rsquo;n&rsquo; ef I don&rsquo; mind their climbin&rsquo; over me, <i>you</i>
      needn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; and against this the undertaker could urge nothing satisfactory.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the intervals of that functionary&rsquo;s activity, conversation was quite
      general, carried on in whispers which, in the aggregate, sounded like the
      rustle of a smart breeze through the dry leaves of a beach tree. Many
      women were there who had never been in the house before&mdash;could
      indeed, have had no other chance of getting in. These had some fleeting
      interest in the funeral appointments, and the expense incident thereto,
      but their chief concern was the furnishing of the house. They furtively
      scraped the carpet with their feet to test its quality, they felt of the
      furniture to see if it had been re-varnished, they estimated the value of
      the curtains, speculated on the cost of the melodeon and its age, wondered
      when the ceiling had last been whitewashed. Some, who knew the family
      better, discussed the lamentable decline of the Fairchilds in substance
      and standing within their recollection, and exchanged hints about the
      endemic mortgage stretching its sinister hand even to the very chairs they
      were sitting on. Others, still more intimate, rehearsed the details of the
      last and fatal illness, commented on the character of individuals in the
      family, and guessed how long old Lemuel would last, now that Cicely was
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the centre of these circling waves of gossip lay the embodiment of the
      eternal silence. Listening, one might fain envy such an end to that living
      death of mental starvation which was the lot of all there, and which
      forced them, out of their womanhood, to chatter in the presence of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The singers came. They were from the village, belonging to the
      Congregational church there, and it was understood that they came out of
      liking for John Fairchild. None of the gathering knew them personally, but
      it was said that the contralto&mdash;the woman with the bird on her
      bonnet, who took her seat at the melodeon&mdash;had had trouble with her
      husband. A fresh buzz of whispering ran round. Some stray word must have
      reached the contralto, for she colored and pretended to study the music
      before her intently, and, later, when &ldquo;Pleyel&rsquo;s Hymn&rdquo; was being sung, she
      played so nervously that there was an utter collapse in the sharps and
      flats of the third line, which nearly threw the singers out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The undertaker now stalked in, and stood on tiptoe to see if the back room
      was also filled. He had been out with the men at the kitchen door, fixing
      crape on the arms of six of the best dressed and most respectable looking
      farmers in an almost jocular mood, and drilling them affably in their
      duties; drinking cider, exchanging gossip with one or two acquaintances,
      and conducting himself generally like an ordinary mortal. He had now
      resumed his dictatorship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the men had followed him around to the front of the house, and
      clustered now in the hall, or in a group about the outer door, holding
      their hats on a level with their shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      A rustle on the stairs told that the mourners were descending. Then came
      the strains of the melodeon, and the singing, very low, solemn and sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little pause, and the full voice of the Baptist preacher was heard in
      prayer&mdash;then in some eulogistic remarks. What he said was largely
      nonsense, from any point of view, but the voice was that of the born
      exhorter, deep, clear-toned, melodious; there seemed to be a stop in it,
      as in an organ, which at pathetic parts gave forth a tremulous, weeping
      sound, and when this came not a dry eye could be found. He was over-fond
      of using this effect, as are most men possessing the trick, but no one
      noticed it, not even Isabel, who from sitting sternly intolerant of the
      whispering women around her, and indignant at Mr. Bunce for his dinner
      performance, found herself sobbing with all the rest when the tremulo stop
      was touched.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was more singing, this time fine, simple old &ldquo;St. Denis&rdquo; and then
      the bearers were summoned in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men asked one another in murmurs outside if the Episcopal clargyman
      was to take no part in the services. Within, Mrs. Wimple went straighter
      to the point. She plucked him by the sleeve of his robe and leaning over
      with some difficulty, for she was a corpulent body, whispered to the
      hearing of a score of her neighbours:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What air you here fer, mister, if you ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to say nor dew
      nothin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I officiate at the grave,&rdquo; he had said, and then regretted all the
      remainder of the day having answered her at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      On the return of the procession from the little knoll where the slate and
      marble tomb-stones of long dead Fairchilds bent over the new brown mound,
      Annie and Seth walked together. There was silence between them for a time,
      which he broke suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s <i>all</i> very hard, Annie, for you know how much mother and I
      loved each other. But, truly, the hardest thing of all is to think of
      staying here among these narrow dolts. While she was here I could stand
      it. But I can&rsquo;t any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annie said nothing. She felt his arm trembling against hers, and his voice
      was strained and excited. What <i>could</i> she say?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not like me,&rdquo; he went on; &ldquo;I have nothing in common with them. I
      hate the sight of the whole of them. I never realised till to-day how big
      a gulf there was between them and me. Didn&rsquo;t <i>you</i> see it&mdash;what
      a mean, narrow-contracted lot they all were?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who do you mean, Seth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why all of them. The Burrells, the Wimples, old Elhanan Pratt, old Lyman
      Tenney, that fellow Bunce&mdash;the whole lot of them. And the women too!
      Did you watch them&mdash;or, what&rsquo;s worse, did you hear them? I wonder you
      can bear them yourself, Annie, any more than I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes it <i>is</i> hard, Seth, I admit; when I first came back to
      grandma from school it was awfully hard. But then I&rsquo;ve got to live here,
      and reconcile myself to what the place offers,&mdash;and, after all, Seth,
      they are well-meaning people, and some of them are smart, too, in their
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well-meaning&mdash;in their way,&mdash;yes! But I haven&rsquo;t got to live
      here, Annie, and I haven&rsquo;t got to reconcile myself, and I <i>won&rsquo;t</i>
      That&rsquo;s the long and short of it. I can make my living elsewhere&mdash;perhaps
      more than my living&mdash;and be among people who don&rsquo;t make me angry
      every time I set eyes on them. And I can find friends, too, who feel as I
      do, and look at things as I do, instead of these country louts who only
      know abominable stories, and these foolish girls&mdash;who&mdash;who&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody can blame you to-day, Seth, for feeling blue and sore, but you
      ought not to talk so, even now. They&rsquo;re not all like what you say. Reuben
      Tracy, now, he&rsquo;s been a good friend and a useful friend to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Rube&rsquo;s a grand, good fellow, of course. I know all that. But then
      just take his case. He&rsquo;s a poor schoolmaster now, just as he was five
      years ago, and will be twenty years from now. What kind of a life is that
      for a man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And maybe the girls <i>are</i>&mdash;foolish, as you started to say, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Annie, don&rsquo;t think I m&rsquo;eant anything by that, <i>please!</i> I know
      you&rsquo;re the dearest girl and the best friend in the world. Truly, now, you
      won&rsquo;t think I meant anything, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Seth, I won&rsquo;t&rdquo; said Annie softly. It was her arm that trembled now.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.&mdash;IN THE NAME OF THE FAMILY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ISS Sabrina sat by
      her accustomed window an hour after the return from the grave, waiting for
      Albert. The mourning dress, borrowed for the occasion from a neighbor, was
      cut in so modern a fashion, contrasted with the venerable maiden&rsquo;s
      habitual garments, that it gave her spare figure almost a fantastic air.
      The bonnet, with its yard of dense, coarse ribbed crape, lay on the table
      at her elbow, beside her spectacles and the unnoticed Bible. Miss Sabrina
      was ostensibly looking out of the window, but she really saw nothing. She
      was thinking very steadily about the coming interview with her nephew, and
      what she would say to him, and wondering, desponding, hoping about his
      answers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened, and Albert entered. &ldquo;You wanted to see me, Aunt, so Annie
      said,&rdquo; he remarked! gravely, in a subdued tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She motioned him to a chair and answered, in a solemn voice curiously like
      his own: &ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s some things I want to say to you, all by yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They sat for some moments in silence, the lawyer watching his aunt with
      amiable forbearance, as if conscious that his time was being wasted, and
      she, poor woman, groping in a novel mental fog for some suitable phrases
      with which to present her views. Under Albert&rsquo;s calm, uninspiring gaze
      those views seemed to lose form, and diminish in intelligence as much as
      in distinctness. It had all been so clear to her mind&mdash;and now she
      suddenly found it fading off into a misty jumble of speculations, mere
      castles in the air. She had expected to present an unanswerable case
      lucidly and forcibly to her lawyer nephew; instead, it seemed increasingly
      probable that he would scout the thing as ridiculous&mdash;and, what was
      worse, be justified in so doing. So it was that she finally made her
      beginning doubtingly, almost dolefully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I dunno haow you feel abaout it, Albert, but I can&rsquo;t help
      thinking something ought to be settled abaout th&rsquo; farm, while yer here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Settled? How settled?&rsquo;&rsquo; asked Albert. There was a dry, dispassionate
      fibre in his voice which further chilled her enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;well&mdash;you knaow&mdash;what I mean, Albert,&rdquo; she said,
      almost pathetically. It was so hard to know just how to say things to
      Albert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, I don&rsquo;t in the least know what you mean. What do you
      want settled about the farm? What is there to settle about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothin&rsquo;, ef yeh don&rsquo;t choose to understand&rdquo; said Miss Sabrina.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another period of silence ensued. Albert made a movement as if to rise,
      and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there is&rsquo;nt anything more, I think I&rsquo;ll go down again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an artificial nicety of enunciation about this speech, which
      grated on the old lady&rsquo;s nerves. She squared her shoulders and turned upon
      her nephew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naow what&rsquo;s the use of bein&rsquo; mean, Albert? Yeh dew knaow what I&rsquo;m
      thinking of, jis&rsquo; ez well ez I dew! Yeh unly want to make it ez hard fer
      me to tell yeh as yeh possibly kin. I s&rsquo;pose thet&rsquo;s the lawyer of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert smiled with all his face but the eyes, and slightly lifting his
      hands from his fat knees, turned them palms up, in mute deprecation of his
      aunt&rsquo;s unreasonableness. The gesture was as near the shoulder-shrug as the
      self-contained lawyer ever permitted himself to go. It was a trifle, but
      it angered the old maid enough to remove the last vestige of hesitation
      from her tongue:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, ef yeh <i>don&rsquo;t</i> knaow what I mean, then I&rsquo;ll tell yeh! I mean
      that ef th&rsquo; Fairchilds are goin&rsquo; to be a Dearborn caounty fam&rsquo;ly, &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      hole their heads up amongst folks, ther&rsquo;s got to be a change o&rsquo; some sort
      right away. Your father&rsquo;s let everything slide year after year, till
      there&rsquo;s pesky little lef&rsquo; naow to slide on. He&rsquo;s behine hand agin in money
      matters, even with th&rsquo; Pratt mortgage on top of t&rsquo;others. What&rsquo;s wuss,
      it&rsquo;s in everybody&rsquo;s maouth. They&rsquo;ve left him off th&rsquo; board at th&rsquo;
      cheese-factory this year, even; of course they say, it&rsquo;s cuz he never &rsquo;tended
      th&rsquo; meetin&rsquo;s&mdash;but I knaow better! It&rsquo;s jis cuz Lemuel Fairchild&rsquo;s
      goin&rsquo; deown hill, &rsquo;n&rsquo; the farm&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to rack &rsquo;n&rsquo; ruin, &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      ev&rsquo;rybuddy knaows it. Jis&rsquo; think of it? Why, &rsquo;twas th&rsquo; Fairchilds
      made that cheese-factory, &rsquo;n&rsquo; it&rsquo;s allus gone by aour name, &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      we used to sen&rsquo; th&rsquo; milk of a hundred &rsquo;n&rsquo; thirty caows there&mdash;almost
      as much as all th&rsquo; rest of &rsquo;em put togither&mdash;&rsquo;n&rsquo; ez I
      said to Leander Crump, when he was squirmin&rsquo; raound tryin&rsquo; to make me
      b&rsquo;lieve they didn&rsquo;t mean nothin&rsquo; by droppin&rsquo; Lemuel aout o&rsquo; th&rsquo; board,
      says I&mdash;&lsquo;nobuddy ever &rsquo;spected a table spoonful o&rsquo; water in
      aour milk!&rsquo;&mdash;&rsquo;n&rsquo; he colored up, <i>I</i> tell yeh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt&rdquo; said Albert, impassively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Sabrina paused to mentally retrace her argument, and see if this
      remark had any special bearing. She could discover none, and grew a little
      angrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, th&rsquo; question&rsquo;s right here. My father, your grand father, made
      a name fer hisself, and a place for his fam&rsquo;ly, here in Dearborn caounty,
      second to nobuddy. Fer years &rsquo;n&rsquo; years I kin remember thet th&rsquo; one
      question people ast, when it was proposed to dew anything, was &lsquo;what does
      Seth Fairchild think &rsquo;baout it?&rsquo; He went to th&rsquo; Senate twice; he
      could &rsquo;a gone to Congress from this dees-trick time &rsquo;n&rsquo; time
      agin, if he&rsquo;d be&rsquo;n a mine to. Ev&rsquo;rybuddy looked up to him. When he died,
      all of a suddent, he lef&rsquo; Lemuel th&rsquo; bes&rsquo; farm, th&rsquo; bes&rsquo; stock, th&rsquo; bes&rsquo;
      farm haouse, fer miles raound. Well, thet&rsquo;s forty year ago. I&rsquo;ve lived
      here threw it all. I&rsquo;ve swallered my pride every day in th&rsquo; week, all thet
      time. I&rsquo;ve tried to learn myself a humble spirit&mdash;but I&rsquo;ve hed to see
      this place, and the fam&rsquo;ly, going daown, daown, daown!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were tears in the old maid&rsquo;s eyes now, as she spoke, tears of
      mortification and revolt against her helplessness, for she seemed to read
      the failure of her appeal in the placid face of her nephew, with its only
      decent pretence of interest. She went on, with a rising voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knaow a little of haow things hev&rsquo; gone, though you&rsquo;ve allus took
      precious good pains to knaow ez little ez yeh could. You knaow that when
      you were a boy you were a rich man&rsquo;s son, with yer pony, &rsquo;n&rsquo; yer
      dancin&rsquo; lessons, &rsquo;n&rsquo; yer college eddica-tion; &rsquo;n&rsquo; yer mother
      dressed well, &rsquo;n&rsquo; had a kerridge, &rsquo;n&rsquo; visited with th&rsquo; bes&rsquo;
      people of Albany, people who were <i>my</i> friends tew when I used to go
      to Albany with yer grandfather. &rsquo;N&rsquo; what hev we come to? Yer mother
      slaved her life aout, lost all her ambition, lost all her pride, saw
      things goin&rsquo; to th&rsquo; dogs and didn&rsquo;t knaow haow to stop &rsquo;em&mdash;sakes
      forbid thet I should say anything agin Sissly; she did all she could;
      p&rsquo;raps &rsquo;twould &rsquo;ev gone different if she&rsquo;d be&rsquo;n a different
      kine o&rsquo; woman, p&rsquo;raps not; there&rsquo;s no use talkin&rsquo; &rsquo;baout thet. &rsquo;N&rsquo;
      ef I&rsquo;d hed <i>my</i> say, tew, maybe things&rsquo;d be&rsquo;n different; but its ez
      it is, &rsquo;n&rsquo; it&rsquo;s no use cryin&rsquo; over spilt milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father never meant to be hard with me. When he lef&rsquo; me nothin&rsquo; but a
      living aout o&rsquo; th&rsquo; farm, he expected, everybuddy expected, my Aunt
      Sabrina&rsquo;d leave me a clean sixty thaousand dollars when she died. She was
      an ole woman, &rsquo;n&rsquo; a widow, &rsquo;n&rsquo; she hed no childern. She&rsquo;d
      allus promised my father thet if I was named after her&mdash;confaound her
      name!&mdash;I shaould be her heir. &rsquo;N&rsquo; then, Iess&rsquo;n a year after
      his death, what does the old huzzy up &rsquo;n&rsquo; do but marry some fortune
      hunter young enough to be her son, &rsquo;n&rsquo; give him every cent she hed
      in the world. He led her a fine dance of it, tew, &rsquo;n&rsquo; serve her
      right! But there I was, lef &rsquo;thaout a thing &rsquo;cep a roof over
      my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;N&rsquo; then Lemuel, nothin&rsquo; ud do but he must go to Californy when
      the gold cry riz, &rsquo;n&rsquo; no sooner&rsquo;d he git there than he was homesick
      &rsquo;n&rsquo; hed to come back; &rsquo;n&rsquo; when he got back, &rsquo;n&rsquo; begun
      to hear what fortunes them who&rsquo;d gone aout with him were a making, than he
      must start aout again. But where it&rsquo;d be&rsquo;n wilderness a few months b&rsquo;fore,
      he faound cities naow, &rsquo;n&rsquo; ev&rsquo;ry chance took up; then he got robbed
      o&rsquo; all his money, &rsquo;n&rsquo; hed to borrer, &rsquo;n&rsquo; then he took chills
      &rsquo;n&rsquo; fever off th&rsquo; isthmus, n&rsquo; hed to lay in quarantine fer weeks,
      on &rsquo;caount o&rsquo; th&rsquo; yellah fever; it&rsquo;d be&rsquo;n a poor year on the farm,
      &rsquo;n&rsquo; when he got back, it took ev&rsquo;ry cent of his ready-money to set
      himself right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From thet day to this, his Californy luck hez stuck to him like death to
      a nigger, tell here, to-day, the Fitches don&rsquo;t think it wuth while to come
      to your poor mother&rsquo;s fun&rsquo;ral&mdash;I kin remember Lije Fitch when he was
      glad enough to beg beans o&rsquo; my father fer seed&mdash;&rsquo;n&rsquo; I&rsquo;m
      wearing borrered mournin&rsquo; of Sarah Andrewses, <i>a mile tew big for me!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me I&rsquo;ve been told all this a good many times, Aunt Sabrina,&rdquo;
       said Albert, as his aunt stopped and glared at him trembling with the
      excitement of her peroration. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing very-pleasant in it, for
      either of us, to listen to or talk about; but I don&rsquo;t see that there&rsquo;s
      anything more than I&rsquo;ve heard over and over again, except about your
      having on another woman&rsquo;s dress, and I don&rsquo;t assume that I am expected to
      interfere about <i>that!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Miss Sabrina was too deeply moved, and too much in earnest, to note
      the sarcastic levity underlying the lawyer&rsquo;s conclusion. She caught only
      the general sense of a negative response, and looked at her nephew
      steadily with a gaze half-indignant, half appealing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you won&rsquo;t dew anything, ay?&rdquo; she asked at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am very far from saying that. <i>That&rsquo;s</i> another thing. You send
      for me, saying that you have an important communication to make to me&mdash;at
      least, I assume that it is important, from the circumstances surrounding
      the request. I come, and you first insist that I know as well as you do
      what you mean, and then, when I demur, you rehearse all the unfortunate
      details of my father&rsquo;s failure in life. I suggest that these are already
      tolerably familiar to me, and <i>this</i> mild statement you construe as a
      definite refusal on my part to do something&mdash;what, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare, Albert, you better send in a bill fer givin&rsquo; me this
      consultation. <i>I</i> never knew a son who could take his father&rsquo;s ruin
      &rsquo;n&rsquo; his fam&rsquo;ly&rsquo;s disgrace so cool, before. I s&rsquo;pose <i>that&rsquo;s</i>
      th&rsquo; lawyer of it, tew!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s an advantage that some one of the family should keep cool,
      Aunt, and look at things one by one, in their true relation. Now, if you
      have any proposition to make to me, any plan to present for my
      consideration, I should like to hear it&mdash;because really this other
      style of conversation is profitless beyond description. In a word, what do
      you want me to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do I want yeh to do?&rdquo; The old maid leaned forward and put a thin,
      mitted hand on Albert&rsquo;s knee, looking eagerly into his face, and speaking
      almost shrilly. &ldquo;I want yeh to take this farm, to come here to live, to
      make it a rich gentleman&rsquo;s home agin! to put the Fairchilds up once more
      where my father left &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; was the provokingly unenthusiastic response.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Sabrina felt that she had failed. She put her spectacles on, and took
      the Bible into her lap, as if to say that she washed her hands of all
      mundane matters. But it did not suit Albert to regard the interview as
      closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one thing you don&rsquo;t seem to see at all, Aunt,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That
      is, that Dearborn County is relatively not altogether the most important
      section of the Republic, and that it is quite possible for a man to win
      public recognition or attain professional distinction in other communities
      which might reconcile him to a loss of prestige here. It may sound like
      heresy to you, but I am free to admit that the good opinion of the
      business men of New York City, where I am regarded as a successful sort of
      man, seems to me to outweigh all possible questions as to how I am
      regarded by Elhanan Pratt and Le-ander Crump and&mdash;and that Baptist
      gentleman, for instance, whom you had here to-day. The world has grown so
      large, my dear aunt, since your day, that there are thousands upon
      thousands of Americans now who go all their lives without ever once
      thinking about Dearborn County&rsquo;s opinion. Of course I can understand how
      deeply you must feel what you regard as a social decline in the eyes of
      your neighbours. But truly, it does not specially affect me. They are not
      my neighbours; if I seem to them to be of less importance than I was in my
      boyhood, when I had a pony, I can&rsquo;t help it, and I am sure I don&rsquo;t want
      to. Frankly, to use my mother&rsquo;s old phrase, I don&rsquo;t care a cotton hat for
      their opinion good, bad, or indifferent. It is this, I think, which you
      leave out of your calculation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Sabrina had listened, with the Book opened only by a finger&rsquo;s width.
      The elaborate irony of her nephew&rsquo;s words had escaped her, but she saw a
      gleam of hope in his willingness to discuss the matter at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then this is the home o&rsquo; the Fairchilds; the fam&rsquo;ly belongs to
      Dearborn Caounty; father was allus spoken of ez Seth Fairchild o&rsquo;
      Dearborn, jis&rsquo; as much ez&mdash;ez Silas Wright o&rsquo; Dutchess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course that last is a powerful argument,&rdquo; said Albert with a furtive
      smile twitching at the corners of his mouth. &ldquo;But, after all, the county
      family idea doesn&rsquo;t seem to attract me much. Why, aunt, do you know that
      your grandfather Roger was a journeyman shoemaker, who walked all the way
      here from Providence. There was nothing incongruous in his son becoming a
      Senator. Very well; if you have a state of society where sudden elevations
      of this sort occur, there will inevitably be corresponding descents&mdash;just
      as lean streaks alternate with fat in the bacon of commerce. The
      Fairchilds went up&mdash;they, come down. They have exhausted the soil. Do
      you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nao! I don&rsquo;t see a bit! &rsquo;N&rsquo; I b&rsquo;lieve at heart you&rsquo;re jis&rsquo; ez
      praoud ez I be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proud? Yes! Proud of myself, proud of my practice, proud of my position.
      But proud because three or four hundred dull countrymen, seeing my cows
      sleek, my harness glossy, my farm well in order, and knowing that my
      grandfather had been a State Senator, would consider me a &lsquo;likely &rsquo;
      man&mdash;no, not at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert rose at this to go, and added, as he turned the door-knob:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as he&rsquo;s equal to it, Aunt Sabrina, I&rsquo;ll get father to go over his
      affairs with me, and I&rsquo;ll try and straighten them out a trifle. I dare say
      we can find some way out of the muddle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But yeh won&rsquo;t take up the thing yerself? Yeh won&rsquo;t dew what I wanted yeh
      tew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer smiled, and said: &ldquo;What really? Come here and be a farmer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Sabrina had risen, too, and came toward her nephew. &ldquo;No&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;not a farmer. Be a country gentleman, &rsquo;n&rsquo;&mdash;&rsquo;n&rsquo;&mdash;a
      Congressman!&rdquo; Albert smiled again, and left the room. He smiled to himself
      going down the stairs, and narrowly escaped forgetting to change his
      expression of countenance when he entered the living room, where were
      sitting people who had not entirely forgotten the fact that it was a house
      of mourning.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Albert had a highly interesting idea in his mind, both interesting and
      diverting. Curiously enough, he had begun developing it from the moment
      when his aunt first disclosed her ambition for him. At the last moment, in
      a blind way she had suggested the first political office that entered her
      mind as an added bribe. She could not know that her astute nephew had,
      from the first suggestion of her plan, been trying to remember whether it
      was Jay and Adams Counties, or Jay and Morgan, that were associated with
      Dearborn in the Congressional district; or that, when she finally in
      despair said &ldquo;Be a country gentleman and a Congressman,&rdquo; his brain had
      already turned over a dozen projects in as many seconds, every one
      Congressional.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.&mdash;THE THREE BROTHERS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>fter the early
      supper of stale bread, saltless butter, dark dried apple sauce, and chippy
      cake had been disposed of, Lemuel returned to his rocking chair by the
      stove, Aunt Sabrina and Isabel took seats, each at a window, and read by
      the fading light, and Albert put on his hat, lighted a cigar, and went
      out. His brother John stood smoking a pipe in the yard, leaning against
      the high well-curb, his hands deep in his pantaloons pocket, and his feet
      planted far to the front and wide apart. Seth was coming from the barns
      toward the well, with a bucket in his hand. Albert walked across to the
      curb, and the three brothers were alone together for the first time in
      years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does one good to be out of doors such an evening as this,&rdquo; said
      Albert. &ldquo;It seems to me it would be better if father would get out in the
      open air more, instead of sitting cooped up over that stove all the
      while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When a man&rsquo;s been out in the open air, rain or shine, snow or blow, for
      fifty years, he ought to have earned the right to stay inside, if he wants
      to. | That&rsquo;s about the only reward there is at the end of a farmer&rsquo;s
      life,&rdquo; answered Seth, turning the calfbucket upside down beside John, and
      sitting on it. Seth had his old clothes on once more, and perhaps there
      was some consciousness of the contrast between his apparel and that of his
      black-clad brethren in the truculent tone of his reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      John had nodded at Albert on his approach, and thrust his feet a trifle
      further forward. He still stood silent, looking meditatively at the row of
      poplars on the other side of the road through rings of pipe smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you don&rsquo;t think much of farm work, eh?&rdquo; said Albert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who does?&rdquo; replied Seth, sententiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      A considerable period of silence ensued. Albert had never had a very high
      idea of his younger brothers&rsquo; conversational qualities, and had rarely
      known how to talk easily with them, but to-night it seemed a greater task
      than ever. He offered them cigars, in a propitiatory way. Seth accepted
      and lit one; John said &ldquo;Thanks, I prefer a pipe,&rdquo; and silence reigned
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was twilight now, and in the gathering dusk there was no sign of motion
      about, nor any sound save the tinkle of a sheep-bell in the pasture
      opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      John&rsquo;s pipe burned out, and Albert pressed a cigar upon him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>want</i> you to try them,&rdquo; he said, almost pleadingly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure
      you&rsquo;ll like them. They are a special brand the steward at the Union League
      gets for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time John consented, and he seemed to feel that the act involved a
      responsibility to talk, for he said, with an effort at amiability as he
      struck a match:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your wife seems to be looking very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Isabel&rsquo;s health is perfect, and it always benefits her to get out in
      the country. That&rsquo;s a kind of Irishism isn&rsquo;t it? I mean it makes her good
      health more obvious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good health is a great thing,&rdquo; John answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation was running emptings again, almost at the start. Albert
      made a heroic effort to strengthen it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this is a regular quakers&rsquo; meeting,&rdquo; he said, briskly. &ldquo;We see each
      other so seldom, we are almost strangers when we do meet. I want to be
      frank with you, come now, and you should be frank with me. You have
      something on your minds, I can see. Isn&rsquo;t it something I ought to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth spoke again: &ldquo;Perhaps on the evening of one&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s funeral it
      isn&rsquo;t to be expected that even brothers should feel chatty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The village journalist felt the injustice of this comment from the
      youngster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Seth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t snap Albert up in that fashion. I dare say he
      feels the thing, in his own way, as much as the rest of us. You are right,
      Albert; there <i>is</i> something, and I&rsquo;ll tell you plainly what it is.
      Do you see those poplars over there? In the morning their shadows Come
      almost to our front door. Father planted them with his own hands. When I
      was a boy, I used to play over there, and climb up on to the bolls, and
      pretend I was to build houses there, like in Swiss Family Robinson. Well,
      that land passed out of our hands so long ago&mdash;it&rsquo;s been an old story
      for years. Do you see the roof of the red school-house over back of the
      hill?&rdquo; turning toward the South. &ldquo;Or no, the light is too poor now, but
      you know where it is. When I used to cut &rsquo;cross lots to school
      there, I went the whole way over father&rsquo;s land. Now, if I wanted to go
      there, how many people would I trespass on, Seth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ferguson owns the clover meadow, and Pratt has the timothy meadow, and
      what we used to call the berry patch belongs to Sile Thomas; he&rsquo;s begun to
      build a house on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely. Why even the fence close to where mother&rsquo;s grave is, divides
      ours from another man&rsquo;s land now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sabrina spoke to me about all this this afternoon,&rdquo; said Albert
      hesitatingly, &ldquo;and I tried, as I often have before, to make her understand
      that that must be the natural course of affairs, so long as the East tries
      to compete with the West in farming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well that may be all right, but Elhanan Pratt seems to manage to compete
      with the West, as you call it, and so do the Fergusons and all the rest of
      them. We are the only ones who appear to get left, every time. Of course,
      it&rsquo;s somebody&rsquo;s fault. Father&rsquo;s been a poor manager, no use of denying
      that. But that doesn&rsquo;t make it any the easier to bear. Father hardly knows
      which way to turn for ours from another man&rsquo;s now. Money; he might have
      scraped through the year if hops had had a good season, but at nine cents
      a pound it was hardly worth while to take them to the depot. You can&rsquo;t
      clear expenses at less than eleven cents. And then if he does have a
      fairly decent year, his hop-pickers are always the most drunken, idle gang
      of them all, who eat their heads off, and steal more fruit and chickens
      than they pick boxes, and if anybody&rsquo;s hops are spoiled in the kiln, you
      can bet on their being Fairchild&rsquo;s, every time. And three years ago, it
      was the hop merchant who failed, just at the opportune moment, and let
      Father in for a whole years&rsquo; profit and labor. Of course, it&rsquo;s all bad
      luck, mismanagement, whatever you like to call it, and it can&rsquo;t be helped,
      I suppose. But it makes a man sour, and it broke poor mother&rsquo;s heart. And
      then here&rsquo;s Seth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, never mind me, I can stand it, I guess, if the rest can. I&rsquo;m not
      complaining&rdquo; came from the figure on the bucket&mdash;only dimly to be
      seen now, in the shadow of the curb, and the increasing darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Seth,&rdquo; continued John, without noting the disclaimer. &ldquo;You and I
      had <i>some</i> advantages&mdash;of course, mine were not to be compared
      with yours, but still I was given a chance, such as it was and I don&rsquo;t
      know that I would trade what I learned at work during college years for a
      college education&mdash;but this poor boy, who&rsquo;s thought about him, who&rsquo;s
      given him a chance to show what&rsquo;s in him? He&rsquo;s been allowed to come up as
      he could, almost like any farm laborer. His mother tried to do her little,
      but what spirit did she have for it, and what time did the drudgery here
      give him? Thank God! He&rsquo;s had the stuff in him to work at education
      himself, and he&rsquo;s got the making of the best man of us three. But it&rsquo;s no
      thanks to you. And <i>that&rsquo;s</i> why we feel hard, Albert. Nobody supposes
      you could make a good farmer and manager out of father; nobody blames you
      for a bad hop season, or the dishonesty of Biggs. But I do say that of us
      three brothers there&rsquo;s one who frets and worries over the thing, and
      though he&rsquo;s a poor man, does all he can afford to do, and more too, to
      help make it better; and there&rsquo;s another, young, ambitious, capable, whose
      nose is held down to the grindstone, and the best years of whose life are
      being miserably spent in a hopeless wrestling with debt and disaster; and
      there&rsquo;s a third brother, the oldest brother, rich, easy, enjoying all the
      luxuries of life, who don&rsquo;t give a damn about it all! <i>That&rsquo;s</i> what I
      say, and if you don&rsquo;t like it, you needn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The silence which ensued was of the kind that can be felt. The two cigars
      at the corners of the old curb glowed intermittently in the darkness.
      John&rsquo;s had gone out during his speech, and as he re-lighted it, the glare
      of the match showed an excited, indignant face. There was no room for
      doubt, after the momentary exhibit which the red light made, that John was
      very much in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert was thinking laboriously on his answer. Meantime, he said, to fill
      the interval &ldquo;Do you like the cigar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; a fifteen center, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert had it in his mind to say truthfully that he paid $180 per
      thousand, but the fear of invidious comparisons rose before him in time,
      and he said &ldquo;About that, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waited a moment, still meditating, and threw out another stop-gap:
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s curious how the rhetorical habit grows on a man who writes leading
      articles. I noticed that you used three adjectives every time, the regular
      cumulative thing, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe so; it would be more to the purpose to hear what you think about
      the spirit of my oration; the form doesn&rsquo;t matter so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I will tell you, John,&rdquo; said Albert, slowly, still feeling his way,
      &ldquo;to speak frankly, no doubt there&rsquo;s a good deal in what you say. I feel
      that there is. But you ought to consider that it isn&rsquo;t easy for a man
      living in a great city, immersed in business cares, and engrossed in the
      labors of his profession, to realise all these things, and see them as
      you, who are here on the ground, see them. It&rsquo;s hardly fair to attack me
      as heartless, when you present these facts to me for the first time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the first time! You ought to have seen them for yourself without
      presenting. And then you said Sabrina had often discussed the subject with
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but her point of view is always family dignity, the keeping up of the
      Fairchilds&rsquo; homestead in baronial state, and that sort of thing. You
      should have heard her this afternoon, telling me how her fathers name used
      to be coupled with Dearborn County, just as Silas Wright&rsquo;s was with
      Dutchess&mdash;either Dutchess or Delaware, I forget which she said&mdash;but
      it was very funny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sabrina and I haven&rsquo;t spoken for I don&rsquo;t know how long, and we&rsquo;re not
      likely to again in a hurry, but for all that I&rsquo;m bound to say I wish some
      others of the family had as much pride as she&rsquo;s got,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;Whatever
      else she may be, she&rsquo;s as loyal and as faithful to the family idea, as
      jealous of the family&rsquo;s name, as any old Spanish grandee. And I confess
      the Silas Wright thing doesn&rsquo;t seem funny to me at all&mdash;any fellow
      with the right kind of a heart in him would feel that it was deucedly
      pathetic&mdash;the poor old maid clinging through the shipwreck to that
      one spar of support&mdash;the recollection of a time when her father was
      bigger than his county. Such things oughtn&rsquo;t to be laughed at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert lost his patience. &ldquo;Confound it, man, do you want to force me into
      a quarrel&mdash;this night of all others! By George, was there ever such a
      brace of brothers! I come out here to get you by yourselves, to talk over
      with you some plans that have occurred to me for setting things right here&mdash;and
      I haven&rsquo;t had a civil answer yet from either of you. First it&rsquo;s the
      youngster who scowls and snarls at me, and then you read me lofty lectures
      on my behavior, and then both together in concerted condemnation. No
      wonder I come rarely to the farm! It&rsquo;s enough to sicken any man of family
      ties, to be bullyragged in this way. I&rsquo;ve a good mind to tell you you can
      all go to the devil, and be hanged to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The figure on the bucket rose to its feet with a spring, so energetically
      that there seemed a menace in the action. The village editor restrained
      this movement with a quiet hand, and a whispered &ldquo;Keep cool, Seth.&rdquo; Then
      he said with exaggerated calmness of voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Personally, perhaps I shouldn&rsquo;t mind much if you did. But there are
      others to look after, and so, before you do, it might be worth while to
      learn what the fine alternative was to have been. It would be a great pity
      to not even to hear these noble plans with which you were primed, you say,
      when you came out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must admit, John, that you and Seth tonight have been enough to
      try the patience of a saint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, we admit that. Go on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve made it a little difficult for me to develop my plans&mdash;they
      were scarcely formed in my mind. In a general way, I wanted to consult you
      about freeing the farm, perhaps buying back some of the original land that
      has gone, putting the house in shape again, improving the stock, placing
      Father and Sabrina beyond the chance of ever being embarrassed again&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;doing
      something for Seth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody wants you&mdash;&rdquo; began the impatient Seth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Youngster, <i>you</i> shut up!&rdquo; said John, again using the quieting hand.
      &ldquo;Do you really mean all this, Albert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should scarcely have spoken in detail as I have, otherwise,&rdquo; answered
      the lawyer loftily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this&mdash;&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;this takes a fellow&rsquo;s breath away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t been in such haste to impute bad motives and convict me
      without judge or jury, perhaps the effect of my plans might not have been
      so overpowering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we did you an injustice, Albert, clearly we did. We were full of the
      idea that all these troubles rolled off you like water off a duck&rsquo;s back.
      It seems that was our mistake. But&mdash;what&rsquo;s your scheme?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Definitely, I have none, except to do all I can, in the way we may decide
      will be best all around. I have been thinking some of coming to live here
      myself, say from May to November of each year, and taking the farm into my
      own hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m&mdash;m! That might have its advantages, perhaps&mdash;<i>but</i>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know what you mean. If I do, everybody&rsquo;s rights shall be respected.
      We&rsquo;ll fix that beyond question, to your satisfaction, before a thing is
      done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about myself, particularly; you know that: but then there&rsquo;s
      Seth, you know&mdash;we&rsquo;ve always figured on the farm as his. It&rsquo;s true he
      don&rsquo;t want to be a farmer, that he hates the whole thing, but still that
      represents all his capital, so to speak, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear John, that shall all be arranged. I am a childless man&mdash;probably
      always shall be. As long as Father lives the farm shall remain in his
      name. Either his will can be in my favor, or I can manage the farm as a
      trustee for all three of us, after he&rsquo;s gone. In either case, you shall
      both be protected in turn by my will&mdash;absolutely protected. Meantime,
      what do you want me to do for Seth? What does he want to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing needs to be done for me,&rdquo; began Seth, &ldquo;I can&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, youngster, <i>will</i> you be quiet!&rdquo; said John, in mock despair.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what you can do for Seth, and do easily. Get him a place on
      some decent newspaper, in New York or one of the larger cities of the
      State, and let him have money enough to eke out a small salary at first,
      so that he can begin at editorial work instead of tramping up through the
      reporter&rsquo;s treadmill, as I had to. That&rsquo;s all Seth&rsquo;ll ask, and it will be
      the making of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begin at editorial work&mdash;Seth? Nonsense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No nonsense about it. For two years back Seth has been doing some of the
      best work on my paper&mdash;work that&rsquo;s been copied all over the State.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless my soul, what a literary family we are!&rdquo; said the lawyer. &ldquo;Does
      Aunt Sabrina write, too? Perhaps those love poems you have on the last
      page are hers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John continued without noticing the interjection. &ldquo;Do you remember that
      long article on Civil Service Reform we had in the <i>Banner</i> last
      January?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I do, John. To be frank, although we enjoy having you send
      us the <i>Banner</i> immensely, occasionally it happens that the stress of
      professional duties compels me to miss reading a number.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well that article was reprinted in all the big papers, from Boston to
      Chicago. I never knew any other thing from a little village paper to
      travel so far, or attract so much attention. I had lots of letters about
      it, too. That article was Seth&rsquo;s&mdash;all his own. I didn&rsquo;t change a word
      in it. And he&rsquo;s hardly seen any thing of the world yet, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer was heard chuckling, when John&rsquo;s voice died away in the
      darkness. The cigars had long since burned out, and the men could with
      difficulty see one another. The two younger brothers waited, the one
      surprised, the other increasingly indignant, to learn the cause of
      Albert&rsquo;s hilarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you realise, John,&rdquo; he said at last, with merriment still in his
      voice, &ldquo;what a delightful commentary on Civil Service Reform your words
      make. The best article on that doctrine is written by a youngster who has
      never left the farm, who doesn&rsquo;t know the difference between a Custom
      House and a letter-box on a lamp-post! Ho, ho, I must tell that to
      Chauncey when I see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, John and Seth still leaned against the mossy curb, smoking
      and talking over the words of their elder brother, who sometime before had
      gone in to avoid the dew-fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if we <i>have</i> misjudged him, after all,&rdquo; said Seth. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      almost ashamed to accept his favors, after the way I pitched into him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what his scheme really is,&rdquo; mused the more experienced village
      editor.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.&mdash;ALBERT&rsquo;S PLANS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t became generally
      known, before Sunday came again, that Albert was to take the farm, and
      that Seth was to go to the city&mdash;known not only along the rough,
      lonesome road leading over the Burfield hills, which had once been a proud
      turnpike, with hospitable taverns at every league, and the rumbling of
      great coaches and the horn of the Postboy as echoes of its daily life of
      bustle and profit, and now was a solitary thoroughfare to no place in
      particular, with three or four gaunt old farmhouses, scowling in
      isolation, to the mile&mdash;not only on this road, and at the four
      corners below, but even at Thessaly people learned of the coming change as
      if by magic, and discussed it as a prime sensation. It need not be added
      that the story grew greatly in telling&mdash;grew too ponderous to remain
      an entity, and divided itself into several varying and, ultimately,
      fiercely conflicting sections.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Misses Cheesborough had the best authority for saying that Albert had
      acted in the most malignant and shameful manner, seizing the farm, and
      turning poor Seth out of doors, and it was more than a suspicion in their
      minds that the feeble old father would soon be railroaded off to an
      asylum.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, Miss Tabitha Wilcox, who by superior vigor and resource
      held her own very well against the combined Misses Cheesbrough, knew,
      absolutely <i>knew</i>, that Albert had behaved most handsomely, paying
      off all the mortgages, making a will in favor of John and Seth, and
      agreeing to send Seth to College, and what was more, Miss Tabitha would
      not be surprised, though some others might be, if the public-spirited
      Albert erected a new library building in Thessaly as a donation to the
      village.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between these two bold extremes there was room for many shades of
      variation in the story, and many original bents of speculation. Down at
      the cheese factory they even professed to have heard that a grand coal
      deposit had been surreptitiously discovered on the Fairchild farm, and
      that Albert was merely the agent of a syndicate of city speculators who
      would presently begin buying all the land roundabout. Old Elhanan Pratt
      did not credit this, but he did write to his son in Albany, a clerk in one
      of the departments, to find out if a charter for a railroad near Thessaly
      had been applied for. The worst of it was, neither John nor Seth would
      talk, and as for Albert, he had gone back to New York, leaving his wife
      behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the farm the fortnight following the funeral passed without event. In
      the lull of field labor which precedes haying time, there was not much for
      Seth to do. He went down to the river several times on solitary fishing
      trips; it seemed to him now that he was saying farewell not only to the
      one pastime which never failed him in interest or delight, but to the
      valley itself, and the river. How fond he was of the stream, and all its
      belongings!
    </p>
    <p>
      More like home than even the old farmhouse on the hill seemed some of
      these haunts to which he now said good-bye&mdash;the shadowed pool under
      the butternut tree, with its high steep bank of bare clay where, just
      under the overhanging cornice of sod, the gypsy swallows had made holes
      for their nests, and at the black base of which silly rock bass lay
      waiting for worms and hooks; the place further up where the river grew
      sharply narrow, and deep dark water sped swiftly under an ancient jam of
      rotting logs, and where by creeping cautiously through the alders, and
      gaining a foothold on the birch which was the key to the obstructing pile,
      there were pike to be had for the throwing, and sometimes exciting
      struggles with angry black bass, who made the pole bend like a whip, and
      had an evil trick of cutting the line back under the logs; and then the
      broader stretch of water below the ruined paper mill&rsquo;s dam, where the
      wading in the thigh-deep rifts was so pleasant, and where the white fish
      would bite in the swift water almost as gamely as trout, if one had only
      the knack of playing his line rightly in the eddies.
    </p>
    <p>
      A score of these spots Seth had known and loved from the boyhood of twine
      and pin hooks; they seemed almost sacredly familiar now, as he wandered up
      and down the stream, dividing his attention between the lures and wiles of
      the angler&rsquo;s art and musings on the vast change of scene which was so
      close before him. Ah, how fair were the day dreams he had idly, fondly
      built for himself here in these old haunts, with kingfishers and water
      rats for sympathizers, and the ceaseless murmur of the water, the buzz of
      the locusts in the sun, the croak of the frogs among the reeds, for a soft
      inspiring chorus of accompaniment to his thoughts!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now these dreams were really to come true; he was actually going to the
      city, to wear decent clothes, to mingle as much as he chose with men of
      wisdom and refinement, to attain that one aim and vision of his life, a
      place on a great paper!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only here by the river, rod in hand, that he seemed able to fully
      realize the beatitude of the vista. So as often as he could he came, and
      if there was a ground note of sorrow at leaving these nooks, this dear old
      river, there was also a triumphant song of exaltation in the air, the
      water, the sunshine, which he could not hear on the farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Partly because these excursions generally led him from the house before
      she made her appearance mornings, partly because he felt vaguely that his
      own victory over fate involved disappointment for her, Seth did not see
      much of Isabel during her husband&rsquo;s absence. So far as he knew, she had
      taken the news of Albert&rsquo;s determination to move into the country quietly
      enough. Neither by word or sign had she discovered to Seth any distaste
      for the prospect. But none the less he had a half-guilty conviction that
      she did not like it, and that she must blame him, or at least have some
      feeling against him, for it. She had spoken so earnestly to him about the
      curse of existence in the country; it was not conceivable to him that she
      should suddenly accept for herself without protests or repining, the very
      life she had thus commiserated with him about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it seemed after all that he was mistaken. It was the evening after
      Albert&rsquo;s return, and Annie had come over after supper, ostensibly to
      borrow a wrapper-pattern from Isabel, but really, it need not be doubted,
      to hear the news.
    </p>
    <p>
      What news there was to be given out the eldest brother dispensed to the
      family circle, after Alvira had cleared away the &ldquo;tea-things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That domestic had a clear idea of making one in the circle, and, hastening
      in from the kitchen without her apron, drew up a chair to sit with the
      others, and enjoy the revelations which, from Albert&rsquo;s manner during
      supper, all felt to be impending. But the invasion of city manners, which
      she and Milton had deplored and ridiculed for a fortnight back, had an
      unsuspected bitterness in its train for her. The lawyer looked at her
      coolly, as he struck a match on the under side of the mantel-piece, and
      asked: &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better go out, Alvira, and see that the chickens don&rsquo;t
      get into the kitchen?&rdquo;&mdash;and she flounced out again, with nose in air,
      and black eyes flashing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert lighted his cigar, put an arm chair down near the old rocker in
      which his father sat and took his seat. Near the open door, overlooking
      the farmyard and the barns, and full in the light from the west, sat Miss
      Sabrina, knitting, and Isabel, with a paper. At the latter&rsquo;s feet, on a
      hassock, was Annie, and Seth sat on the doorstep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Albert, &ldquo;things have been arranged in New York so that I
      can speak, now, about the plans which I hinted of ten days ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man nodded his head, and said plaintively, &ldquo;Whatever yew think
      best, Albert, s&rsquo;long as the boys git a fair shaow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t worry about that. My business is settled now, I think, so
      that I can live here six or eight months in the year, say from March till
      October, running down occasionally, perhaps, but making this my residence.
      I will take up all the mortgages&mdash;perhaps buy back some of the old
      farm, may be all of it. There are three or four ways in which this can be
      equitably arranged&mdash;we&rsquo;ll talk of those in detail later on, some day
      when John can come up. I will have the carpenters here in a few days, to
      look over the house, and figure on putting it in first-class repair. The
      barns will have to be new throughout. There must be new machinery, new
      fences, and a pretty thorough weeding out of the cattle. We shall want a
      carriage house&mdash;but then its no use of enumerating, there is so much
      to be done. We will put some money into horseflesh down on Long Island,
      and see if something can&rsquo;t be done in the way of a stock-farm. I&rsquo;m
      thinking of a trout pond, up beyond the orchard, in the ravine there,
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Albert, this is what I&rsquo;ve be&rsquo;n prayin&rsquo; for this thirty year!&rdquo; It was
      Sabrina who spoke. There were tears of joy in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lemuel Fairchild seemed rather dazed, not to say dismayed, at the prospect
      thus bewilderingly unfolded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll cost a heap o&rsquo; money, Albert,&rdquo; he said
      at last, rather dubiously, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I dunnao&rsquo; &rsquo;baout yer gittin&rsquo; it
      back agin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will be <i>my</i> look out,&rdquo; said the lawyer, confidently. &ldquo;At any
      rate, Isabel and I will make a good home for you and Aunt Sabrina, as long
      as you both live. It will be a pleasant change for us both. As for Seth&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause, and Annie nestled closer to Isabel, with a soft &ldquo;Oh
      yes, about Seth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for Seth, it&rsquo;s time he saw something of life besides grubbing here
      like a farm-hand. We will try and get along without him here. I&rsquo;ve talked
      the matter over with a friend of mine, the proprietor of the Tecumseh <i>Chronicle</i>
      and he is willing to give him a start there, under the most favorable
      conditions. The salary will be small at first, of course, but I will
      supplement it with enough to give him a decent living, if he is frugal.
      After that of course it all depends on himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth stood up, as these last words were spoken, and replied, stammeringly.
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be afraid of my not trying hard, Albert. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m very
      grateful to you. It&rsquo;s more than I dared expect you would do for me.&rdquo; He
      pushed his way past the women to shake hands with his brother, and say
      again &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so good of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert received these expressions of gratitude benevolently, adding some
      words of advice, and concluding with &ldquo;You had better get ready to start as
      early next week as you can. One of the <i>Chronicle</i> men is going on a
      vacation, and its Workman&rsquo;s idea that you would be handy in his absence.
      You could go, say, Wednesday, couldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as getting ready is concerned, I don&rsquo;t know that there is anything
      to do which couldn&rsquo;t be done in a day. But&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you will need some things. I&rsquo;ll talk with you about that in the
      morning. We&rsquo;ll drive down to Thessaly day after to-morrow together.&rdquo;
       Albert rose with this to go out and see Milton, and the family interview
      was at an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Sabrina hurried out to the kitchen, impatient to begin discussing
      with Alvira, as had been her wont for years, this new development in the
      affairs of the household.

      CHAPTER IX.&mdash;AT &ldquo;M&rsquo;TILDY&rsquo;s&rdquo; BEDSIDE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>emuel Fairchild
      sat still, smoking his wooden pipe, and looking absently, straight ahead,
      into the papered wall. This habit of gazing at nothing was familiar to
      them all, and when, at Isabel&rsquo;s suggestion, the three young people started
      for a stroll through the orchard path, they left him entirely without
      ceremony. This was growing to be the rule; no one in the family now
      consulted him, or took the trouble to be polite to him. He seemed to have
      become in his own house merely an article of animated furniture, of not
      much more importance than the rough-furred sickly old cat who dozed his
      life away back of the stove.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat thus in solitude for some time, blankly studying the grotesque
      patterns in the old-fashioned wall-paper, and drawing mechanically at the
      pipe in his mouth, unconscious that no smoke came. Thus Miss Sabrina found
      him when, after a more than ordinarily sharp passage at arms with Alvira,
      she returned from the Kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swaow! thet girl gits wuss tempered &rsquo;n&rsquo; more presumin&rsquo; ev&rsquo;ry day
      o&rsquo; her life,&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&mdash;Annie?&rdquo; asked her brother, rousing himself as if from a nap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Annie! nao! who&rsquo;s talkin&rsquo; abaout <i>her?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh nothin&rsquo;, unly I was thinkin&rsquo; &rsquo;baout Annie&mdash;&lsquo;baout her &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      Seth, yeh knaow,&rdquo; answered Lemuel, apologetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what abaout &rsquo;em?&rdquo; The query was distinctly aggressive in
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothin&rsquo; much. I was sort o&rsquo; thinkin&rsquo;&mdash;well, <i>you</i> knaow
      S&rsquo;briny, haow Sissly used to lot on their makin&rsquo; a match of it&mdash;&rsquo;n&rsquo;
      I was kine o&rsquo; wond&rsquo;rin&rsquo; ef this here notion o&rsquo; Seth&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; away wouldn&rsquo;t
      knock it all in th&rsquo; head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Miss Sabrina&rsquo;s monosyllabic comment had so little of sympathy or
      acquiescence in it, that Lemuel continued in an injured tone and with more
      animation, not to say resolution:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve hed kine of an idea o&rsquo; goin&rsquo; over &rsquo;n&rsquo; talkin&rsquo; it over
      with M&rsquo;tildy. Mebbe that&rsquo;ll be the best thing to dew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh <i>you</i> think so, dew yeh? Thet&rsquo;s all th&rsquo; pride <i>you&rsquo;ve</i> got
      lef&rsquo;, is it? I think I see <i>my</i>self goin&rsquo; hangin&rsquo; raound Matildy
      Warren, beggin&rsquo; her to let her granddaughter marry a Fairchild! I&rsquo;m
      ashamed of yeh, Lemuel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo; see, much, what ther&rsquo; is to be ashamed on.&rdquo; He added, with the
      faintest shadow of a grin on his face. &ldquo;&rsquo;N&rsquo; b&rsquo;twixt you &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      me, I don&rsquo;t see &rsquo;s there&rsquo;s so blamed much fur me to be praoud
      abaout, nuther. &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t&rsquo;s if I was goin&rsquo; to ask a favor o&rsquo; M&rsquo;tildy, at
      all. She &rsquo;n&rsquo; Sissly used to talk &lsquo;baout the thing&rsquo;s if &rsquo;twas
      settled. &rsquo;N&rsquo; now&rsquo;t she&rsquo;s gone, &rsquo;n&rsquo; Seth&rsquo;s talkin&rsquo; o&rsquo;
      quittin&rsquo; th&rsquo; farm, seems to me it&rsquo;d be the sensible thing to kind o&rsquo; fine
      aout ef M&rsquo;tildy wouldn&rsquo;t offer th&rsquo; young folks her farm, ef they&rsquo;d stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Very</i> well, sir. Hev&rsquo; yer own way,&rdquo; answered Miss Sabrina, with
      stern formality. &ldquo;You allus <i>would</i> hev yer own way&mdash;and yeh kin
      go muddle things up to yer heart&rsquo;s content, for all o&rsquo; me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lemuel watched his sister march to the stairs door and close it decisively
      behind her. He was accustomed of old to this proof of her wrath; as far
      back as he could remember it had been Sabrina&rsquo;s habit to figuratively wash
      her hands of unpleasant complications on the ground-floor by slamming this
      self-same door, and going up to sulk in her own room. She did it as a
      young girl, in the first months of her disagreements with his young wife;
      it seemed to him a most natural proceeding now, when they were both old,
      gray-headed people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just now, it was a relief to him that she had gone, for if she had stayed
      he might not have had the courage to put his thoughts into actions. As it
      was he took his hat from its nail back of the kitchen door, and started
      across-lots for the Warren homestead.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no danger of not finding Mrs. Warren at home. For seven or eight
      years she had scarcely stirred beyond her own door, and for the past
      eighteen months she had been bed-ridden. The front door was opened to Mr.
      Fairchild by a young slip of a girl, one of the brood of daughters with
      which a neighboring poor family was weighted down, and all of whom had
      been driven to seek work at any price among the farmers of the vicinity.
      It seemed as if there was a Lawton girl in every other farmhouse the whole
      length of the Burfield road.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl ushered him into the gloomy hall, gloomier than ever now in the
      gathering twilight, and unceremoniously left him there, while she went to
      announce his presence. He heard through a door ajar at the end of the hall
      a thin, querulous voice ask, &ldquo;Which one of the Fairchilds is it?&rdquo; and the
      girl&rsquo;s reply &ldquo;The old man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the servant returned to him and with a curt &ldquo;Come ahead,&rdquo; led him to
      the mistress of the house, who lay in her bed-home, in a recess off the
      living room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Matilda Warren had never been what might be called a popular woman in
      the neighborhood. She and her husband, the latter dead now for many years,
      had come from Massachusetts. They were educated people in a sense, and had
      not mingled easily with their rougher neighbors. The widow Warren had,
      after her daughter&rsquo;s escapade, carried this exclusiveness to a point which
      the neighborhood found disagreeable. Gradually she had grown into the
      recluse habit, and younger generations on the hillside, eking out the
      gossip of their elders with fancies of their own, born of stray glimpses
      of her tall, gaunt figure and pale face, came to regard her with much that
      same awe which, two centuries before, reputed witches had for children,
      young and old.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something of this feeling Lemuel himself was conscious of, as he stood
      before her. The coverlet came up close under her arms. She wore a
      wrapper-dress of red flannel. As he entered she raised herself, with an
      evidently cruel effort, upon her elbow, dragging the pillow down to aid in
      supporting her shoulder. She panted with this exertion as she confronted
      him. Her scanty white hair was combed tightly back from her forehead, and
      bound in place with a black-velvet band; a natural parting on the side of
      the hair gave the withered face a suggestion of juvenile jauntiness, in
      grotesque, jarring contrast with the pale blue eyes which glittered from
      caverns of dark wrinkles, and the sunken, distorted mouth. She had changed
      so vastly since their last meeting that Lemuel stood bewildered and
      silent, staring at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke first. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to think&mdash;it must be twenty year since
      we&rsquo;ve met, Lemuel Fairchild.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nigh onto that, M&rsquo;tildy,&rdquo; he replied, turning his hat in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect ever to lay eyes on you again, I couldn&rsquo;t come to you,
      and wouldn&rsquo;t if I could, and I didn&rsquo;t dream you would ever show your face
      here.&rdquo; The aged woman said this in a high, sharp voice, speaking rapidly
      and with an ungracious tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lemuel fidgetted with his hat and moved his feet uneasily on the dog-skin
      rug. &ldquo;Yeh needn&rsquo;t be afeered, M&rsquo;tildy, I wouldn&rsquo;t hev come naow ef it
      hadn&rsquo;t been somethin&rsquo; partikler &rsquo;baout Annie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The invalid raised her shoulder from the pillow with a sudden movement,
      and bent her head forward. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened to her? Is she hurt? Tell me,
      quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh nao, they ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; th&rsquo; matter with her. It&rsquo;s unly &rsquo;baout
      her &rsquo;n&rsquo; Seth. I kine o&rsquo; thought we ought to talk it over &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      see haow the land lay. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh that&rsquo;s it, is it? <i>Samantha!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betrayed out of her shrewdness by the suddenness of the summons the
      servant girl made her immediate appearance through the hall door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I knew you were listening, you huzzy,&rdquo; said Mrs. Warren grimly. &ldquo;You
      get along up stairs, go into Annie&rsquo;s room, an&rsquo; make a noise of some sort
      on the melodeon till I call you. Not too much noise, mind; jest enough so
      I can know you&rsquo;re up there.&rdquo; As the girl left the room, the invalid
      explained: &ldquo;What she don&rsquo;t hear, the rest of the Lawtons won&rsquo;t know. That
      family&rsquo;s as good as a detective force for the whole county.&rdquo; Then, in a
      less amiable tone: &ldquo;You might as well set down. What is it about my girl
      an&rsquo; Seth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Lemuel awkwardly seated himself near the bedside and prepared to
      answer, a wailing, discordant series of sounds came from the floor above.
      The knowledge that the girl was creating this melancholy noise to order,
      and on his account, confused his thought and he found himself stating the
      case much more baldly than he had intended. &ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; he said,
      stroking his hat over his knee, &ldquo;Seth&rsquo;s thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; goin&rsquo; away to Tecumsy&mdash;Albert&rsquo;s
      got him a place there&mdash;&rsquo;n&rsquo; so I s&rsquo;pose it&rsquo;ll be all up b&rsquo;twixt
      him &rsquo;n&rsquo; Annie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The grandmother never took those light, searching eyes off her visitor&rsquo;s
      face. He felt himself turning uncomfortably red under their malevolent
      gaze, I and wished she would speak. But she said nothing. At last he
      explained, deferentially:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it&rsquo;d only be right to tell yeh. I know Sissly &rsquo;n&rsquo; you
      use to talk abaout th&rsquo; thing. Th&rsquo; way she use to talk, speshly jis&rsquo; &rsquo;fore
      she died, it &rsquo;peared &lsquo;s if you tew hed it all settled. But Albert&rsquo;s
      goin&rsquo; to take th&rsquo; farm, it seems, &rsquo;n&rsquo; Seth, he&rsquo;s fig&rsquo;rin&rsquo; on goin&rsquo;
      away to be a neditor, &rsquo;n&rsquo; it looks to me&rsquo;s if th&rsquo; hull plan&rsquo;d fell
      threw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still no reply from the bed. He added, helplessly &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t it kind o&rsquo; seem
      so to you, M&rsquo;tildy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wretched discords from the chamber above mocked him. The witch-like
      eyes from the shadows of the recess began to burn him. It was growing into
      the dusk, but the eyes had a light of their own, a cold, steely, fierce
      light. Would she never speak? How he regretted having come!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what seems to me, Lemuel Fairchild,&rdquo; she said at last, not
      speaking so rapidly now, and putting a sharp, finishing edge on each of
      her words. &ldquo;It seems to me that there&rsquo;s never been but one decent,
      honorable, likely human bein&rsquo; in your whole family an&rsquo; she came into it by
      the mistake of marrying you. I blame myself for not remembering the blood
      that was in you all, an&rsquo; for thinking that this youngest son of yours was
      different from the rest. I forgot that he was a Fairchild like the others,
      an&rsquo; I forgot what I owed that family of men, so mean and cowardly and
      selfish that they have to watch each other like so many hyenas. An&rsquo; so
      you&rsquo;ve come to tell me that Seth has turned out like his father, like his
      uncle, like all of his name, eh? The more fool I, to need to be told it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lemuel&rsquo;s impulse was to rise from his chair, and bear himself with
      offended dignity, but the glitter in the old woman&rsquo;s eyes warned him that
      the attempt would be a failure. He scowled, put his hat on the other knee,
      crossed his legs, pretended to be interested in the antics of a kitten
      which was working havoc with a ball of yarn at his feet. Finally he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t fair to Seth. He&rsquo;s a good boy. He ain&rsquo;t said nothin&rsquo; nor done
      nothin&rsquo; fer yeh to git mad at. Fer that matter, you never was fair to any
      of us, &rsquo;cept Sissly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair! <i>Fair!</i>&rdquo; came the answer promptly, and in a swifter measure.
      &ldquo;Hear the man! Why, Lemuel Fairchild, you know that you cheated your own
      brother out of the share in that farm that was his by all rights as much
      as yours. You <i>know</i> that your father intended you both to share
      alike, that he died too suddenly to make a new will and that you grabbed
      everything under a will made when your brother William was thought to be
      too sickly to ever raise. You <i>know</i> that you let him grow up an
      idle, worthless coot of a fellow, an&rsquo; then encouraged him&mdash;yes, don&rsquo;t
      deny it, encouraged him I say&mdash;to make a fool of my daughter, and run
      away with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew I wouldn&rsquo;t look at him as a suitor for Jenny; but you thought I
      would be soft enough, once they were married, to give him my farm, an&rsquo; you
      counted on getting it away from him afterwards, just as your father got
      the Kennard farm before you. You egged him on into the trouble, an&rsquo; you
      let him die in it, without help. Oh <i>I</i> know you, Lemuel Fairchild&mdash;I
      know your breed!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your <i>wife</i> was a good woman&mdash;a million times better than you
      deserved. <i>She</i> knew the wrongs that had been done me, an&rsquo; Annie, an&rsquo;
      her poor ne&rsquo;er-do-well of a father before her; <i>she</i> was anxious to
      make them good, not I. It was she who talked, year after year, when she
      ran over here on the sly to visit me, of squaring everything by the young
      folk&rsquo;s marriage. For a long time I didn&rsquo;t like it. I distrusted the
      family, as, God knows, I had reason to. But all that I heard of Seth was
      in his favor. He was hardworking, patient, even-tempered, so everyone
      said. What little I saw of him I liked. An&rsquo; I felt sorry for him, too,
      knowing how dear he was to his mother, and yet how helpless she was to
      give him advantages, an&rsquo; make something besides a farm-drudge out of him.
      So little by little, I gave in to the idea, an&rsquo; finally it became mine
      almost as much as Cecily&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for Annie, I don&rsquo;t know how much she has grown to care for him; I&rsquo;m
      afraid she&rsquo;s known about our talks, and lotted on &rsquo;em, though if
      anything has passed between them she would have told me. For she&rsquo;s a good
      girl&mdash;a <i>good</i> girl&mdash;and she&rsquo;ll stand by me, never fear,
      and say as I say now, that it&rsquo;s good riddance! D&rsquo;ye mind? Good riddance to
      bad rubbish&mdash;to your whole miserable, conniving, underhanded family!
      There ain&rsquo;t an honest hair in your head, Lemuel Fairchild, and there never
      was. And you can go back to them that sent you, to your old catamaran of a
      sister and your young sneak of a son, and tell &rsquo;em what I think of
      them, and you, and the whole caboodle of you, that ruined and killed my
      Jane, and made me a broken old woman before my time, and now tries to
      break my grand-daughter&rsquo;s heart! And the longest day you Jive, don&rsquo;t ever
      let me lay eyes on you again. That&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lemuel groped his way out again through the dark hall, to the front door.
      The groaning discords from upstairs rose to a triumphant babel of sound as
      he knocked against the hat-rack, and fumbled for the latch, as if to
      emphasize and gloat over his discomfiture. The cold evening air, after the
      sweltering heat of the sick-room, was a physical relief, but it brought no
      moral comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Lemuel was much pained, and even more confused, by the hard words to
      which he had had to listen. They presented a portrait of himself which he
      felt to be in no way a likeness, yet he could not say wherein a single
      line should be altered. He knew that he was not a bad man; he felt
      conscious of having done no special wrong, intentionally, to anybody; he
      had always tried to be fair and square and easy-going with everybody: yet
      the mischief of it was that all these evil things which the witchlike
      M&rsquo;tildy had piled at his door were of indubitable substance, and he could
      not prove, even to himself, much less to her, that they did not belong
      there. It was a part of the consistently vile luck of his life that all
      these malignant happenings should be charged up against him, and used to
      demonstrate his wickedness. He had not enough mental skill or alertness to
      sift the unfair from the true in the indictment she had drawn, or to put
      himself logically in her place, and thus trace her mistakes. He only
      realized that all these events which she enumerated had served to convince
      Mrs. Warren that he was a villain. The idea was a new one to him, and it
      both surprised and troubled him to find that, as he thought the matter
      over he could not see where she was particularly wrong. Yet a villain he
      had certainly never intended to be&mdash;never for a moment. Was this not
      cruelly hard luck?
    </p>
    <p>
      And then there was this business about Seth. He had meant it all in the
      friendliest spirit, all with the best of motives. And how she had snapped
      him up before he had a chance to explain, and called him a scoundrel and
      his boy a sneak, and driven him from the house! Here was a muddle for one&mdash;and
      Sabrina had said he would make a muddle of it, as he had of everything
      else, all through his life. The lonely, puzzled, discouraged old man felt
      wofully like shedding tears, as he approached his own gate&mdash;or no, it
      was Albert&rsquo;s gate now&mdash;and passed the young people chatting there,
      and realized what a feeble old fool they all must think him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.&mdash;THE FISHING PARTY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he young people
      were arranging, as Lemuel slunk past them in the dark, a fishing party for
      the following day. The proposal had been Isabel&rsquo;s&mdash;she had a fertile
      mind for pleasure planning&mdash;and Annie and Seth were delighted with
      it. They would take a basket of food, and make the tea over a fire in the
      woods, and the two women could take turns in playing at fishing with a
      little rod which Seth had made for himself as a boy. It would be an ideal
      way of bidding good-bye to Seth, said his pretty sister-in-law, and Annie,
      feeling more deeply both the significance of saying good-bye and the charm
      of having a whole day to herself along the river and in his company, had
      assented eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Seth, this sudden accession of feminine interest in, and concern
      for, him was extremely pleasant and grateful. The very suggestion of the
      trip, in his honor, was like a sweet taken in advance from the honeyed
      future which he was so soon to realize. Long that night, after he had
      walked over to the Warren gate with Annie, and returned to the unlathed
      attic where Milton lay already snoring, he thought fondly of the morrow&rsquo;s
      treat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning came, warm but overcast, with a soft tendency of air from the
      west. &ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t have been better if it had been made to order,&rdquo; Seth
      said enthusiastically, when Isabel made her appearance before breakfast.
      &ldquo;It will be good fishing and good walking, not too hot and not wet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert smiled a trifle satirically when the project was unfolded to him&mdash;with
      that <i>conceited tolerance which people who don&rsquo;t fish always extend to
      those who do</i>. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll probably get wet and have the toothache&rdquo; he said
      to his wife, but offered no objection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lunch was packed, the poles were ready, the bait-can stood outside the
      shed door, breakfast was a thing of the past, and Isabel sat with her
      sunhat and parasol&mdash;but Annie did not come. Seth fidgeted and fumed
      as a half-hour went by, then the hour itself. It was so unlike Annie to be
      late. He made an errand to the hay-barn, to render the waiting less
      tedious, and it was there that Milton found him, rummaging among some old
      harness for a strap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Annie&rsquo;s come over,&rdquo; said Milton, &ldquo;I heerd her say somethin&rsquo; &rsquo;baout
      not goin&rsquo; fishin&rsquo;, after all. Looks &rsquo;sif she&rsquo;d be&rsquo;n cryin&rsquo; tew. I
      tole &rsquo;em I&rsquo;d fetch yeh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth came out into the light, slapping the dust off his hands. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
      that you say? Why isn&rsquo;t she going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunnao nothin&rsquo; more &rsquo;n I&rsquo;ve told yeh. Ask her yerself. I &rsquo;spose
      she&rsquo;s be&rsquo;n cryin&rsquo; at the thought of yer goin&rsquo;. That&rsquo;ll be the eend o&rsquo;
      ev&rsquo;rythin&rsquo; atwixt you two, won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do mind your own business, Milton!&rdquo; Seth said, and hurried across the
      barnyard to where the two young women stood, on the doorstep. &ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t
      you going, Annie? What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he called out as he approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Annie looked the picture of despair. Her face bore the marks of
      recent tears and she hung her head in silence. Isabel answered for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going? Of course she is going. It would be ridiculous not to go, now that
      everything&rsquo;s arranged. Get the things together, Seth, and let us make a
      start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Milton said she wasn&rsquo;t going,&rdquo; persisted Seth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, dear, how downright you are! Don&rsquo;t I tell you that she <i>is</i>
      going, that there is nothing the matter, that we are waiting for you?&rdquo; And
      there was nothing more to be said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun came out before the trio had gone far, but not before they had
      begun to forget the cloud at the start. The grass in the pastures was not
      quite dry yet, but wet feet were a part of the fun of the thing, Isabel
      said gaily. The meadow larks careened in the air about them, and the
      bobolinks, swinging on the thistle tops, burst into chorus from every side
      as the sunlight spread over the hill-side. There were robins, too, in the
      juniper trees beyond the white-flowering buckwheat patch, Seth pointed
      out, too greedy to wait till the green berries ripened. A flock of crows
      rose from the buckwheat as they passed and who could help smiling at
      Isabel&rsquo;s citified imitation of their strident hawing? They came upon some
      strawberries, half-hidden in the tall grass beside the rail-topped wall,
      and Isabel would gather them in her handkerchief, to serve as dessert in
      their coming <i>al fresco</i> dinner, and Annie helped her, smiling in
      spite of herself at the city lady&rsquo;s extravagant raptures.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they stopped to rest, in the fresh-scented shadow of the woods, and
      sat on a log along the path, two wee chipmunks came out from the brake
      opposite and began a chirping altercation, so comical in its suggestions
      of human wrangling that they all laughed outright. The sound scared away
      the tiny rodents in a twinkling, and it banished as swiftly the restraint
      under which the excursion had begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that moment it was all gayety, jesting, enjoyment. Isabel was the
      life of the party; she said the drollest things;&mdash;passed the
      quaintest comments,&mdash;revealed such an inexhaustable store of spirits
      that she lifted her companions fairly out of their serious selves. Seth
      found himself talking easily, freely, and even Annie now and again made
      little jokes, at which they all laughed merrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fisherman&rsquo;s judgment as to the day was honored in full measure. The
      fish had never bitten more sharply, the eddies had never carried the line
      better. It seemed so easy, to let the line wander back and forth between
      the two currents, to tell when the bait was grabbed underneath, and to
      haul out the plunging, flapping beauty, that Isabel was all eagerness to
      try it, and Seth rigged the little pole for her, baited the hook
      self-sacrificingly with his biggest worm, which he had thought of in
      connection with a certain sapient father of all pike further up the river,
      and showed her where and how to cast the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas, it was not so simple, after all, this catching of fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      First she lost a hook on a root; then it seemed to her that ages passed in
      which nothing whatever happened and this was followed by the discovery
      that her hook had entirely been stripped of bait without her suspecting
      it. At last there came a bite, a deep, determined tug, which she answered
      with a hysterical pull, hurling through the air and into the thistles far
      back of her a wretched little bull-head which they were unable to find for
      a long time, and which miserably stung her thumb with its fin when she
      finally did find it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this exploit Annie must try, and she promptly twitched her line into
      the tree overhead. And so the day went forward, with light-hearted
      laughter and merriment, with the perfect happiness which the sunshine and
      color and perfume of June can bring alone to the young.
    </p>
    <p>
      They grew a trifle more serious at dinner time. It was in the narrow
      defile where the great jam of logs was, and where the river went down,
      black and deep, under the rotting wood with a vicious gurgle. Just above
      the jam there was a mound, velvety now with new grass, and comfortably
      shaded&mdash;a notable spot for dinner and a long rest, and then the girls
      could watch to much advantage Seth&rsquo;s fishing from the logs, of which great
      things were prophesied. Here then the cloth was spread on the grass, the
      water put on over a fire lighted back of the mound, and the contents of
      the basket laid in prandial array. It was in truth a meagre dinner, but
      were appetites ever keener or less critical?
    </p>
    <p>
      Once during the forenoon, when allusion was made to Seth&rsquo;s coming
      departure, Isabel had commanded that nothing be said on that subject all
      day long. &ldquo;Let us not think of it at all,&rdquo; she had said, &ldquo;but just enjoy
      the hours as if they would never end. That is the only secret of
      happiness.&rdquo; But now she herself traversed the forbidden line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How strange it will all seem to you, Seth,&rdquo; she mused, as she poured out
      the tea. &ldquo;As the time draws near, don&rsquo;t you almost dread it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I&rsquo;ve been thinking most about to-day is your coming to the farm to
      live. It can&rsquo;t be that you are altogether pleased&mdash;after what I&rsquo;ve
      heard you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, why not?&rdquo; said Isabel. &ldquo;My case is very different from yours. I
      shall be just as idle as I like. I shall have horses, you know and a big
      conservatory, and a piano, and all that. We shall have lots of people here
      all summer long&mdash;just think what fishing parties we can make up!&mdash;and
      whenever it gets stupid we can run down to New York. Oh, I&rsquo;ve got quite
      beyond the reconciled stage now. I am almost enthusiastic over it. When
      you come back in a year&rsquo;s time, you won&rsquo;t know the place. It will have
      been transformed into a centre of fashion and social display. I may get to
      have a veritable salon, you know, the envy and despair of all Dearborn
      County. Fancy Elhanan Pratt and Sile Thomas in evening dress, with patent
      leather pumps and black stockings, scowling at Leander Crump, with a
      crushed hat under his arm, whom they suspect of watering his milk! Oh, we
      shall be gay, I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth looked at her attentively, puzzled to know how much of this was
      badinage, how much sincerity. She smiled archly at him&mdash;what a
      remarkably winning smile she had!&mdash;and continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Annie will be company for me, too. I mean to bring her out, you
      know, and make her a leader of society. In a year&rsquo;s time when you come
      back and I introduce you to her, you won&rsquo;t be able to credit your senses,
      her air will be so <i>distingué</i>, and her tastes so fastidious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ceased her gay chatter abruptly, for Annie had turned away and they
      could see that her eyes were filling with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seth bethought him of those earlier tears, the signs of which had been so
      obvious when they started, and it was natural enough to connect the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something <i>has</i> happened, Annie,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you tell us what
      it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then he bit his tongue at having made the speech, for Annie turned a
      beseeching look at him, then at Isabel, and burst into sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it reason enough that you are going away?&rdquo; said Isabel. &ldquo;What more
      could you ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t that alone,&rdquo; protested Annie through her tears. Her pride
      would not brook the assumption. &ldquo;There is something else; I can hardly
      tell you&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;my grandmother has suddenly taken a
      great dislike to Seth; if she knew where I was she would be very angry: I
      never deceived her, even indirectly, before, but I couldn&rsquo;t bear not to
      come after I got to the house, and if I&rsquo;ve done wrong&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, now dear&rdquo; cooed Isabel, leaning over to take Annie&rsquo;s hands, &ldquo;what
      nonsense to talk of wrong; come now, dry your eyes, and smile at us, like
      a good girl. You are nervous and tired out with the task of tending your
      grandmother&mdash;that&rsquo;s all&mdash;and this day in the woods will do you a
      world of good. Don&rsquo;t let us have even the least little bit of unhappiness
      in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth watched his sister-in-law caress and coax away Annie&rsquo;s passing fit of
      gloom, with deep enjoyment. The tenderness and beauty of the process were
      a revelation to him; it was an attribute of womanhood the existence of
      which he had scarcely suspected heretofore, in his untutored, bucolic
      state. Annie seemed to forget her grief quickly enough, and became
      cheerful again; in quaint docility she smiled through her tears at
      Isabel&rsquo;s command, and the latter was well within the truth when she cried:
      &ldquo;There! You have never looked prettier in your life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth nodded acquiescence, and returned the smile. But somehow this grief
      of Annie&rsquo;s had bored him, and he felt rather than thought that his
      country-cousin, even in this radiant moment, was of slight interest
      compared with the city sister-in-law, who not only knew enough not to cry
      herself, but could so sweetly charm away tears from others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seth tested all the joints of his pole, and changed the hook and baited it
      with studious care, before he climbed out on the jam. Gingerly feeling his
      way from log to log, he got at last upon the wet mossy birch which
      projected like a ledge at the bottom of the pile. The women watched his
      progress from the mound, and gave a little concerted shout of triumph
      when, at the very first cast of his line into the froth of the dark eddy,
      it was caught and dragged swiftly across the stream, and a handsome pike a
      moment later paid the penalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s by far the biggest yet, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Annie asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, there are bigger yet. Watch this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The line, thrown in again, had been sharply jerked and was now being drawn
      upstream under the logs. Seth moved down to the end of the birch, stooping
      under the jutting heap of logs above, to be able to play the pole
      sidewise, and save the fish. It was a difficult position to stand in; he
      held the rod far forward with one hand, and grasped a bough above for
      support as he leaned out over the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing snapped&mdash;exactly how it was no one knew&mdash;a log
      released from its bondage shifted position, a dozen others rolled over it
      rumbling, and the women held their breath affrighted as they saw, without
      moving, the whole top of the jam tremble, lift a jagged end or two, and
      then collapse with a hollow noise. As they found voice to scream, the
      water was covered with floating debris, and the air filled with a musty
      fungus-like smell.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no sign of Seth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The roar of the falling timber had scarcely died away before Annie had
      left the mound, had torn her way through the alders at the bottom, and
      stood panting on the wet slimy rocks at the edge of the stream. She hardly
      heard the frightened warning which Isabel, pale and half-fainting, called
      out to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep away from the water, Annie! You&rsquo;ll surely be drowned!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was painfully intent upon another thing, upon the search for some
      indication of her cousin. The logs were moving but slowly in the current,
      and were heaped so irregularly that no clear survey of the whole surface
      could be had. There seemed an eternity of suffering in every second which
      she spent thus, scanning the scene. Could the crush of logs have killed
      him? Even if he had escaped that, would he not be drowned by this time?
      The grinding of the logs against each other, the swash of the water at her
      feet, Isabel&rsquo;s faint moaning on the mound above, seemed to her dazed
      terror a sort of death dirge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, joy! She caught sight of something in cloth between two great
      tree-trunks, drenched, covered with the red grime of rotten wood,
      motionless; but it was Seth. His face she could not see, nor whether it
      was under water or not. She walked boldly into the stream&mdash;kneedeep
      at the outset, and the slippery rocks shelving off swiftly into unknown
      brown-black depths&mdash;but there was no hesitation. A halfdozen steps,
      and she disappeared suddenly beneath the water. Isabel wrung her hands in
      despair, too deep now to find a voice; but Annie had only slipped on the
      treacherous slates, and found her footing again. The water came to her
      shoulders now, and was growing deeper steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a strength born of desperation she clambered up on the birch, which
      floated nearest her, and pulled herself along its length, swaying as it
      rolled in the current under her weight, but managing to keep on top. It
      was nothing short of miraculous to Isabel&rsquo;s eyes, the manner in which she
      balanced herself, clambered from log to log, overcame all the obstacles
      which lay between her and the inanimate form at the other side. The
      distance was not great, and a swimmer would have made nothing of the feat,
      but for a girl encumbered with heavy wet skirts, and in deep water for the
      first time, it was a real achievement.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she reached Seth&mdash;her progress had covered three minutes, and
      seemed to her hours long&mdash;and, throwing herself across both logs,
      with a final effort lifted his head upon her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is alive!&rdquo; she said to Isabel, feebly now, but with a great sigh of
      relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      The city woman ran down at this, all exultation. At Annie&rsquo;s suggestion,
      she tied their two shawls together, fastened one end to a pole, and
      managed to fling the other over to the rescuer; it was easy work after
      that to draw the logs to the bank, and then Annie, standing knee-deep
      again in the water, made shift to get the heavy dead weight safe on land.
      The two women tugged their burden through the alders, and up to the place
      where the dinner dishes still lay, with scarcely a word. Then exhausted,
      excited, overjoyed, Isabel threw herself in Annie&rsquo;s arms and they both
      found relief in tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seth had been struck on the head and stunned by the first falling log; how
      much he had been in the water or how near he had been to drowning could
      not be discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He presently opened his eyes, and a smile came almost instantaneously to
      his face as he realised that his head was resting in Isabel&rsquo;s lap, that he
      was muffled up in her shawl, and that she was looking down upon him
      anxiously, tenderly. A second sufficed to bring the whole thing to his
      mind, or at least the facts that he had gone under with the logs and by
      some agency had been landed here safe and comfortable, if not dry&mdash;and
      to bring also the instinctive idea that it would be the intelligent part
      to lie still, and be petted and sympathised with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isabel scarcely returned his smile. She had not recovered from her fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Seth,&rdquo; she asked earnestly, &ldquo;Are you hurt? Do you feel any pain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit&rdquo; he replied&mdash;&ldquo;only dizzy like. By George! How they did
      come down though. I must have had a pretty narrow squeak of it. Funny&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t remember coming out at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled now. &ldquo;I should think not. You lay perfectly senseless way out
      there among the logs. We fished you out, and dragged you up here. I feel
      like a heroine in a Crusader&rsquo;s romance, really!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It entered Seth&rsquo;s mind to say something nice in reply, that she looked
      like one, or that they were not equal in those benighted ages to producing
      such women, or something of that sort; but his tongue did not seem to
      frame the words easily and as he looked up at her he grew shy once again,
      and felt himself flushing under her smile, and only said vacuously,
      &ldquo;Mightly lucky I wasn&rsquo;t alone, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Annie appeared on the scene now,
      her clothes steaming from the heat of the fire, over which she had
      endeavoured to dry them, and her teeth displaying a spasmodic tendency to
      knock together between sentences. She too was full of solicitude as to
      Seth&rsquo;s condition, and to satisfy this he reluctantly sat up, stretched his
      arms out, felt of the bump on his forehead, beat his chest, and finally
      stood erect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right, you see&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;only, bo-o-o, I&rsquo;m cold,&rdquo; and he
      made for the fire, upon which Annie had heaped brushwood, which crackled
      and snapped now, giving forth a furious heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood about the fire for a considerable time. Isabel was opposite
      Seth, rather ostentatiously drying sundry damp places in her dress which
      had come in contact with the rescued man&rsquo;s dripping hair and clothes. He
      was so interested in watching her, and in thinking half-regret fully,
      half-jubilantly, that she had been put to this discomfort in saving his
      life, that he failed to notice how completely drenched his cousin had
      been. The conversation turned entirely, of course, upon the recent great
      event, but it was desultory and broken by long intervals of silence, and
      somehow Seth did not get any clear idea of how he was saved, much less of
      the parts the two women had respectively played in the rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be unfair to say that Isabel purposely misrepresented anything;
      it is nearer the truth to describe her as confounding her own anxiety with
      her companion&rsquo;s action. At all events, the narrative to be gleaned from
      her scattering descriptions and exclamations had the effect of creating in
      Seth&rsquo;s mind the impression that he could never be sufficiently grateful to
      his sister-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Annie, the whole momentous episode had come so swiftly, had been so
      imperative, exhaustive in its demands of all her faculties, and then had
      so suddenly dwindled to the unromantic conditions of drying wet clothes at
      a brush fire, that her thoughts upon it were extremely confused. She
      scarcely took part in the conversation. Perhaps she felt vaguely that her
      own share in the thing was not made to stand forth with all the prominence
      it deserved, but she took it for granted that, in his first waking
      moments, while he was alone with Isabel, Seth had been told the central
      fact of her going into the water for him, and, if he was not effusively
      grateful, why&mdash;it was not Seth&rsquo;s way to be demonstrative. Besides she
      said to herself, she did not want to be thanked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, late that night, long hours after Seth had said good-night to her
      at the Warren gate, and she had almost guiltily stolen up to her room
      without braving her grandmother&rsquo;s questions, Annie could not go to sleep
      for thinking:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He might at least have <i>looked</i> some thanks, even if he did not
      speak them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days later, Seth departed for the city. It was not a particularly
      impressive ceremony, this leave-taking, not half so much as he had
      imagined it would be.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had risen early, dressed himself in one of the two new, ready-made,
      cheap suits Albert had bought for him at Thessaly and packed all his
      possessions in the carpet satchel which had been in the family he knew not
      how long&mdash;and still found, when he descended the stairs, that he was
      the first down. It was a dark, rainy morning, and the living room looked
      unspeakably desolate, and felt disagreeably cold. He sat for a long time
      by a window pondering the last copy of John&rsquo;s <i>Banner</i>, and trying to
      thus prepare his mind for that immense ordeal of daily newspaper work,
      that struggle of unknown, titanic proportions, now close before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alvira at last came in to lay the breakfast table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, you up already?&rdquo; was all she said; but he felt she was eyeing him
      furtively, as if even thus soon he was a stranger in the house of his
      birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Sabrina next appeared. &ldquo;There! I knew it &rsquo;d rain,&rdquo; she
      exclaimed. &ldquo;I told Alviry so last night. When th&rsquo; cords on th&rsquo; curtains
      git limp, yeh can&rsquo;t fool me &rsquo;baout it&rsquo;s not rainin&rsquo;. &rsquo;N&rsquo;
      Seth, I hope you&rsquo;ll go to Church regular whatever else you dew. &rsquo;N&rsquo;
      ef yeh could take a class in th&rsquo; Sunday schewl, it&rsquo;d go a long ways tow&rsquo;rd
      keepin&rsquo; yeh aout o&rsquo; temptation. Will yeh go to th&rsquo; Baptist Church, think?
      Th&rsquo; Fairchilds &rsquo;v&rsquo; allus be&rsquo;n Baptists.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The breakfast passed in constrained silence, save for Albert, who
      delivered a monologue on the evils of city life, and the political and
      ethical debauchery of the press, to which Seth tried dutifully to pay
      attention&mdash;thinking all the while how to say goodbye to Isabel, how
      to invest his words with a fervor the others would not suspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the time came, all this planning proved of no avail. He found himself
      shaking hands as perfunctorily with her as with her husband, and his
      father and aunt. Only the latter kissed him, and she did it with awkward
      formality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he climbed into the buggy where Milton and the carpet bag were
      already installed, and, answering in kind a chorus of &ldquo;Good-byes&rdquo; drove
      out into the rain&mdash;and the World.

      CHAPTER XI.&mdash;ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE WORLD.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>eth&rsquo;s first
      impressions of the World, gathered when he found himself and his valise
      alone on the sidewalk of one of Tecumseh&rsquo;s chief streets, were distinctly
      gloomy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other passengers who had left the train here, and in whose throng he had
      been borne along thus far, started off briskly in various directions once
      they reached the busy thoroughfare, elbowing their way through the horde
      of clamorous hotel porters much as one might push through a clump of
      obstructing bushes. He had firmly fixed in his mind the cardinal rule of
      traveling countrymen, that these shouting runners were brigands intent
      upon robbing him, and he was clear in his resolution to give them no hold
      upon him, not even by so much as a civil expression of countenance. He
      said &ldquo;No, thank you!&rdquo; sternly to at least a dozen solicitations, so it
      seemed to him, and walked away steadily, fearful that their practised eyes
      had detected in him an utter stranger, and intent only upon proving to
      them that he knew where he was going. When at last it seemed likely that
      they were no longer watching him, he stopped, put his bag down in a door
      way, and looked about.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was half-past six of a summer afternoon (for a failure to make
      connections had prolonged the sixty-mile journey over eight hours), and
      the sun, still high, beat down the whole length of the street with an
      oppressive glare and heat. The buildings on both sides, as far as eye
      could reach, were of brick, flat-topped, irregular in height, and covered
      with flaring signs. There was no tree, nor any green thing, in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Past him in a ceaseless stream, and all in one direction, moved a swarm of
      humanity&mdash;laborers and artisans with dinner-pails, sprucely dressed
      narrow-chested clerks and book-keepers, and bold faced factory-girls in
      dowdy clothes and boots run down at the heels&mdash;a bewildering,
      chattering procession. No one of all this throng glanced at him, or paid
      the slightest attention to him, until one merry girl, spying his forlorn
      visage, grinned and called out with a humorous drawl &ldquo;Hop-pick&mdash;ers!&rdquo;
       and then danced off with her laughing companions, one of whom said, &ldquo;Aw,
      come off! You&rsquo;re rushin&rsquo; the season. Hop&rsquo;s ain&rsquo;t ripe yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth felt deeply humiliated at this. He had been vaguely musing upon the
      general impudence of his coming to this strange city to teach its people
      daily on all subjects, from government down, while he did not even know
      how to gracefully get his bag off the street. This incident added the
      element of wounded self-pride to his discomfort&mdash;for even casual
      passers-by were evidently able to tell by his appearance that he was a
      farmer. Strange! neither Albert nor John had told him anything calculated
      to serve him in this dilemma. They had warned him plentifully as to what
      not to do. Indeed his head was full of negative information, of pit-falls
      to avoid, temptations to guard against. But on the affirmative side it was
      all a blank. John had, it was true, advised him to get board with some
      quiet family, but if there were any representatives of such quiet families
      in the crowd surging past, how was he to know them?
    </p>
    <p>
      While he tormented himself with this perplexing problem, two clerks came
      out of the store next to which he stood, to pull up the awning and prepare
      for night. A tall young man, with his hands deep in his trouser&rsquo;s pockets,
      and a flat straw hat much on one side of his head, sauntered across the
      street to them, and was greeted familiarly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Tom,&rdquo; shouted one of these clerks, &ldquo;you just everlastingly gave it
      to that snide show to-night. <i>Wasn&rsquo;t</i> it a scorcher, though?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man with the straw hat put on a satisfied smile: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the
      only way to do it,&rdquo; he said lightly. &ldquo;The sooner these fakirs understand
      that they can&rsquo;t play Tecumseh people for chumps, the better. If the <i>Chronicle</i>
      keeps on pounding &rsquo;em, they&rsquo;ll begin to give us a wide berth. Their
      advance agent thought he could fix me by opening a pint bottle of
      champagne. That may work in Hornellsville, but when he gets to-night&rsquo;s <i>Chronicle</i>
      I fancy he&rsquo;ll twig that it doesn&rsquo;t go down here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, by the way, Tom,&rdquo; said the other clerk, in a low tone of voice, &ldquo;my
      sister&rsquo;s engaged to Billy Peters. I don&rsquo;t know that she wants to have it
      given away, that is, names, and everything, but you might kind o&rsquo; hint at
      it. It would please the old folks, I think&mdash;you know father&rsquo;s taken
      the <i>Chronicle</i> for the last twenty years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know&rdquo; said Tom, producing an old envelope from a side pocket and making
      some dashes on it with a pencil&mdash;&ldquo;the regulation gag: &lsquo;It is rumored
      that a rising young hat-dealer will shortly lead to the altar one of the
      bright, particular social stars of Brewery street &rsquo; eh? Something
      like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it. You know how to fix it so that everybody&rsquo;ll know who is
      meant. Be around at Menzel&rsquo;s to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe I&rsquo;ll look in. The beer&rsquo;s been fearfully flat there,
      though, this last carload. So long, boys!&rdquo;&mdash;and Tom moved down the
      street while the clerks re-entered the store.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seth followed him eagerly, and touched him on the shoulder, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir, but I heard you mention the <i>Chronicle</i> just
      now. I would be much obliged if you could tell me where the office is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man turned, looked Seth over and said, affably enough:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. But you&rsquo;ll find it shut up. The book-keeper&rsquo;s gone home.&rdquo; Then
      he added, as by a happy afterthought: &ldquo;If you want to pay a weekly
      subscription, though, I can take it, just as well as not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Seth, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to work on the <i>Chronicle</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;printer? I guess some of the fellows are there still, throwing
      in their cases. If you like, I&rsquo;ll show you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth replied, with some embarrassment, &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not a printer. I&rsquo;ve come
      to be&mdash;to be&mdash;an editor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom&rsquo;s manner changed in a twinkling from civility to extreme cordiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;ho! you&rsquo;re the new man from Thessaly, eh? Jack Fairchild&rsquo;s
      brother! By Jove! How <i>are</i> you, anyway? When did you get in? Where
      are you stopping?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not stopping anywhere&mdash;unless it be this stairway here,&rdquo; Seth
      replied, pointing to his carpetbag with a smile, for his companion&rsquo;s
      cheerfulness was infectious. &ldquo;I came in half an hour ago, and I scarcely
      knew where to go, or what to do first. I gather that you are connected
      with the <i>Chronicle</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I should remark!&rdquo; said Tom, taking the bag up as he spoke. &ldquo;Come
      along. We&rsquo;ll have some supper down at Bismarck&rsquo;s, and leave your grip
      there for the evening. We can call for it on our way home. You&rsquo;ll stop
      with me to-night, you know. It ain&rsquo;t a particularly fly place, but we&rsquo;ll
      manage all right, I guess. And how&rsquo;s Jack?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the delight of finding so genial a colleague, one, too, who had known
      and worked with his brother, Seth&rsquo;s heart rose, as they walked down the
      street again. He had been more than a little dismayed at the prospect of
      meeting these unknown writers whose genius radiated in the columns of the
      <i>Chronicle</i>, and in whose company he was henceforth to labor.
      Especially had he been nervous lest he should not speak with sufficient
      correctness, and should shock their fastidious ears with idioms insensibly
      acquired in the back-country. It was a great relief to find that this
      gentleman was so easy in his conversation, not to say colloquial.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stopped presently at a broad open door, flanked by wide windows, in
      which were displayed a variety of bright-tinted play bills, and two huge
      pictures of a goat confidently butting a small barrel. There was a steep
      pile of these little, dark-colored barrels on the sidewalk at the curb,
      from which came a curious smell of resin. As they entered, Seth discovered
      that this odor belonged to the whole place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interior was dark and, to the country youth&rsquo;s eyes, unexpectedly vast.
      The floor was sprinkled with gray sand. An infinitude of small, circular
      oak tables, each surrounded with chairs, stretched out in every direction
      into the distant gloom. Away at the farther end of the place, somebody was
      banging furiously on a piano. In the middle distance, three elderly men
      sat smoking long pipes and playing dominoes, silently, save for the sharp
      clatter of the pieces. Nearer, three other men, seated about a table, were
      all roaring in German at the top of their lungs, pounding with their
      glasses on the resounding wood, and making the most excited and menacing
      gestures. While Seth stared at them, expecting momentarily to see the
      altercation develop into blows, he felt himself clutched by the arm, and
      heard Tom say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bismarck, this is Mr. Fairchild, a new <i>Chronicle</i> man. You must use
      him as well as you do me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth turned and found himself shaking hands with an old German monstrous
      in girth, and at once fierce and comical in aspect, with short, upright
      gray hair, a huge yellowish-white moustache, and little piggish blue eyes
      nearly hidden from view by the wave of fat which rendered his great purple
      face as featureless as the bottom of a platter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who effer vas Misder Vott&rsquo;s frent, den you bed he owens dis whole
      houwus,&rdquo; this stout gentleman wheezed out, smiling warmly, and releasing
      Seth&rsquo;s hand to indicate, with a sweeping gesture of his pudgy paw, the
      extent of Seth&rsquo;s new and figurative possessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the invitation of the host they all took seats, and a lean,
      wolfish-faced young man named &ldquo;Ow-goost,&rdquo; who shuffled along pushing his
      big slippers on the floor, brought three tall foaming glasses of
      dark-brown beer. Seth did not care for beer, and had always, in a general
      way, avoided saloons and drink, but of course, under these circumstances,
      it would be ridiculous not to do as the others did. The beverage was
      bitter, but not unpleasant, and with an effort he drank it half down at a
      time, as he saw his companions do. Then he looked about, while they
      discussed the merits of this new &ldquo;bock,&rdquo; Tom speaking with an air of great
      authority, and pronouncing it better than the last, but a bit too cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The piano was still jangling, and the dominoes were being rattled around
      for a new game. The three noisy old men had grown, if possible, more
      violent and boisterous than ever. One of them now sprang to his feet,
      lifted his right hand dramatically toward the dusky ceiling, and bellowed
      forth sonorously something which Seth thought must be at least a challenge
      to immediate combat, while the others hammered their glasses vehemently,
      and fairly shrieked dissent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid those men are going to fight,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fight? Nonsense! They&rsquo;re rather quieter than usual,&rdquo; remarked Tom. &ldquo;What
      are they chewing on to-night, Bismarck&mdash;the Sigel racket?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said their host, listening indifferently. &ldquo;Dot&rsquo;s Sigel.&rdquo; Then,
      addressing Seth, he explained: &ldquo;Somedimes it&rsquo;s Sigel, unt somedimes the
      reffolution uff forty-eighd, unt den somedimes der k-vestion of we haf a
      vood bafement by Main streed. It all makes no differunce to dem, vicheffer
      ding dey shdarts mit, dey git yust so much oxcited. Dot rooster you see
      standing up mit der spegtacles, dot Henery Beckstein, he&rsquo;s a tailor; he
      sits mid his legs tvisted all day, den when night comes he neets some
      exercises. Efery night for tweluf years he comes here, unt has his liddle
      dalk, und de udders, dey alvays pitches into him. He likes dot better as
      his dinner. De vurst is, dey all don&rsquo;t know vat dey talk aboud. I bleef,
      so help me Gott, no one of &rsquo;em ever laid eyes by Sigel, unt dey all
      svear he vas deir dearest frent. Now&mdash;hear dot! Dot Beckstein say uff
      he didn&rsquo;t shleep mid him four years in his dent, in de same bet! How was
      dot for lies, huh?&rdquo; The host, pained and mortified at this mendacity, left
      his seat and waddled over to the disputants, shouting as he went, and
      joined the conversation so earnestly that his little eyes seemed bursting
      from his beet-red face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great old man, that,&rdquo; said Tom, pounding with his glass for the waiter;
      &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no flies on <i>him!</i> I named him Bismarck three or four years
      ago&mdash;everybody calls him that now&mdash;and it tickled him so,
      there&rsquo;s nothing here too good for me. You like cheese, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes, I eat cheese sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth never <i>had</i> eaten this kind of cheese which Owgoost presently
      slapped down before them, along with a mustard cup, a long bulging roll of
      black bread, and more beer. It was pale and hard and strong of scent, was
      cut in thick slabs, and was to be eaten, he judged from Tom&rsquo;s procedure,
      under a heavy top-dressing of the brown mustard. He liked it though, and
      was interested to find how well beer went with it, or it went with beer.
      Then they had each a little pickled lambs-tongue, pink and toothsome, to
      be eaten with plenty of salt, and it was quite remarkable how ideally beer
      seemed to go with this, too. In all, three large glasses went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom was a delightful companion. It was simply charming to hear him talk,
      as he did almost continuously, describing the round of life in Tecumseh,
      relating gay little anecdotes of personal experience, and commenting
      trenchantly on various men as they came in. To some of these he introduced
      Seth. They seemed extremely affable young people, and some of them who
      took seats near by invited Tom and him with much fervor and still greater
      frequency, to have their glasses filled up. The former accepted these
      proffers very freely, but the beer did not taste as good to Seth as it had
      during supper, and he kept to his one glass&mdash;the fourth&mdash;sipping
      at it from time to time. Tom was so urgent about it, though, that he did
      take a cigar, a dark, able-bodied cigar which annoyed him by burning up on
      one side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beer-hall presented a brilliant appearance now, with all the lights
      flaming, with most of the chairs filled by merry young men, with three or
      four white-jacketed waiters flitting about, bearing high in air both hands
      full of foaming glasses&mdash;a fine contrast to the dingy, bare interior
      of the twilight, with only the solitary Owgoost. Above the ceaseless hum
      of conversation and laughter, rose, at intervals, the strains of lively
      music from the far-off piano, reinforced now by a harp and a flute.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time cards were proposed, and Tom made one of a quartette who
      ranged themselves at the table. Seth could not play, and so moved his
      chair back, to watch the game. His cigar burned badly and he relighted it.
      Then it tasted bitter, and, after some hesitation, he threw it away. The
      game, called seven-up, was one he had never seen before; the ten-spots
      were invested with a fictitious value which puzzled him. Tom, over whose
      shoulder he watched had three of these tens, and silently indicated to
      Seth that they were of especial interest. Seth fixed his eyes upon them,
      to see how they were to be managed. They were very curious ten-spots,
      being made of beer-glasses running over with lambs-tongues, with lambs
      chasing them to rescue their lamented members, and burly &ldquo;Bismarck&rdquo;
       striving in vain to secure order. General Sigel came to help him, and Tom
      dealt him a terrific blow. Here <i>was</i> a fight at last, and John
      Fairchild stood by, rapidly taking notes. Then it came bed-time, and&mdash;Seth
      was being shaken into sensibility by Tom, who said between fits of
      chuckling:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wake up, old boy! Wake up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another great change had taken place in the beer-hall&mdash;the lights
      were out, the music had ceased, the crowd was gone. A solitary gas-jet
      flickered from the chandelier over the table; the game was ended, and the
      players were standing ready to depart, and laughing. Fat Bismarck stood
      behind him, in the half-shadow, looking very sleepy, and he seemed to be
      grinning too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seth saw all this first. Then he discovered that he held his collar and
      necktie in his hand, and that his coat and waistcoat were on the table. He
      dimly began to understand that he had been asleep, and that, in the
      operation of his dream, he had commenced undressing. Everybody was
      laughing at him, his friend Tom, who now was helping him on with his coat,
      most heartily of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare,&rdquo; Seth said, &ldquo;I must have fallen asleep. I had no idea&mdash;I
      suppose I was dreaming of getting ready for bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dots all right, dots all right,&rdquo; said Bismarck heartily. &ldquo;Ve don&rsquo;d
      mind it a bit. You vas only dired owut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;he&rsquo;d had a hard day of it, traveling all the
      way from Thessaly. Are you ready? We&rsquo;ll get the bag, and trot along home.
      Good night, boys!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth responded to the chorus of answering &ldquo;good nights,&rdquo; and the twain
      started out. Tom not only carried the bag, but took his companion&rsquo;s arm&mdash;much
      to Seth&rsquo;s satisfaction, for he felt very tired, and it seemed unusually
      difficult for him to shake off his sleepiness. Tom was more talkative than
      ever, and he seemed to be saying extremely clever things, but Seth somehow
      did not follow their meaning, and he could think of nothing to say in
      reply. They were in a dark side street now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I thought he&rsquo;d be open!&rdquo; said Tom, abruptly, stopping before a place,
      through the closed shutters of which long horizontal threads of light
      gleamed. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go in and have a night-cap. It&rsquo;ll set you straight in a
      minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The curious reluctance to speak, of which Seth had felt vaguely conscious
      all along, now prompted acquiescence as the easiest course, and he
      followed Tom into a small, low room, thick with cigar-smoke and the odor
      of kerosene, where four or five men, with their hats tilted over their
      eyes, were playing cards: there was a pile of money in the centre of the
      table, to which each in turn seemed to be adding from a smaller heap
      before him. They were so much engrossed in the game that they only nodded
      at Tom, and Seth felt relieved at escaping the ordeal of being introduced
      to them. At Tom&rsquo;s suggestion he took a little glass of brandy&mdash;&ldquo;to do
      their duty by the National debt,&rdquo;&mdash;what ever that meant. It was
      burning, nauseous stuff, which brought the tears to his eyes, but it made
      him feel better.
    </p>
    <p>
      It especially enabled him to talk, which he proceeded to do now with a
      fluency that surprised him. Tom was evidently much impressed by his
      remarks, saying little, it is true, but gripping his arm more closely.
      Thus they walked to Tom&rsquo;s lodgings&mdash;a tall, dark brick house opposite
      a long line of coal sheds. The hall was so dark that Seth, in trying to
      follow his guide, stumbled over an umbrella-rack, and fell to the floor.
      Tom assisted him to rise, with a paternal &ldquo;steady now, steady; that&rsquo;s it,
      lean on me,&rdquo; and so helped him up the two flights of steep, narrow stairs.
      In all the world, it seemed to Seth, he could not have met a more amiable
      or congenial friend than Tom, and he told him so, as they climbed the
      stairs, affectionately leaning upon his arm, and making his phrases as
      ornate in diction and warm in tone as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; said Tom, opening a door, and lighting a lamp which
      revealed a small, scantily furnished room, in extreme disorder. &ldquo;Make
      yourself at home, my boy. Smoke a pipe before you go to bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mercy, no. I thinks&mdash;do you know, I feel a little dizzy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll be all right in the morning. Just undress and pile into bed.
      I&rsquo;ll smoke a pipe first.&rdquo; Half an hour after Seth&rsquo;s first day in the World
      had closed in heavy slumber, Tom looked at him before blowing out the
      light, and smiled to himself: &ldquo;He <i>is</i> about as fresh as they make &rsquo;em.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.&mdash;THE SANCTUM.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he young men
      dressed next morning in almost complete silence. Tom was still sleepy, and
      seemed much less jovial and attractive than he had been the previous
      evening; Seth, accustomed to far earlier rising, was acutely awake, but
      his head ached wearily and there was a dreadful dryness in his mouth and
      throat. They went through the forms of breakfast in the basement, too,
      without much conversation. Seth was ashamed of the number of cups of
      coffee he drank, and carried away only confused recollections of having
      been introduced to a middle-aged woman in black who sat at the head of the
      table, and of having perfunctorily answered sundry questions about
      business in Dearborn County, put by a man who sat next to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were well on their way to the office before Tom&rsquo;s silent mood wore
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must brace up!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let Workman know that we were out
      together last night. He&rsquo;s a regular crank about beer&mdash;that is, when
      anybody but himself drinks it. What&rsquo;s the matter? You look as melancholy
      as a man going to be hanged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;m nervous about the thing. It&rsquo;s all going to be so new and
      strange at the start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;ll be all right. You&rsquo;ll get the hang of it fast enough. They are
      rather decent fellows to work with upstairs, all but Samboye. He&rsquo;ll try to
      sit on you from the start, but if you hold your own with him you&rsquo;ll get
      along with the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Samboye&mdash;he&rsquo;s the editor, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You don&rsquo;t know any of them, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even by name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, after Workman, who&rsquo;s very rightly named, and who runs the thing,
      there&rsquo;s Samboye, who koo-toos to Workman and bullies all the rest. He puts
      on more airs than a mowing machine agent at a state fair. He makes <i>everybody</i>
      tired. Next to him comes Tyler&mdash;Tony Tyler, you&rsquo;ll like him&mdash;that
      is, if he takes a fancy to you. He knows about eighteen hundred times as
      much as Samboye does, only somehow he hasn&rsquo;t the faculty of putting it on
      paper. Too much whisky. Then there&rsquo;s Dent&mdash;he&rsquo;s a Young Man
      Christian; plays duets on the piano with his sister, you know, and all
      that sort of thing&mdash;but he&rsquo;s away now on his vacation. And then Billy
      Murtagh&mdash;he&rsquo;s a rattling good fellow, if you don&rsquo;t let him borrow
      money of you. He does part of the telegraph and news. Those are the only
      fellows upstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where do you come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me? Oh, I&rsquo;m the City Editor. I and my gang are downstairs. I made a
      strike to have you down with me, and put you on police court, but Workman
      wouldn&rsquo;t have it. It&rsquo;s all poppycock, for they&rsquo;ve got more men upstairs
      now than they know what to do with. However, if Workman thinks the people
      want to read editorials on the condition of Macedonia more than they do
      local news, he can go ahead. It&rsquo;s none of my funeral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what special work I am to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From all I hear, it would be easier to tell what you&rsquo;re not to do.
      Everyone of them has got a scheme for unloading something on you. First
      you&rsquo;re to do a lot of Dent&rsquo;s work, like the proofs and Agricultural and
      Religious; then Murtagh wants to put State News on you, and Tyler tells me
      you&rsquo;ve got to do the weekly as soon as you get your hand in, and Art,
      Music and the Drama is a thing that must go up stairs, now that the
      baseball season has begun, for I can&rsquo;t attend to it. But if they play it
      too low down on you, just you make a stout kick to Workman about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Seth pondered this outlook and advice, they reached the <i>Chronicle</i>
      office, and presently, by a succession of dark and devious stair-ways, he
      found himself in an ancient cockloft, curiously cut up by low partitions
      into compartments like horse-stalls, each with a window at the end, and
      was introduced as &ldquo;the new man&rdquo; to Mr. Anthony Tyler, otherwise Tony.
    </p>
    <p>
      This gentleman bore no outward signs of the excess of spirituous liquor to
      which Tom had alluded, and was very cordial and pleasant. He was extremely
      dark in hair, beard and eyes, seemed to be not more than thirty, and sat
      at a table piled high with books, clippings and the like, and surrounded
      by great heaps of papers. Tom glanced over two or three of these latter,
      and then went off humming a tune lightly and calling out to Seth in
      imitation of a popular air, as he rattled down stairs &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll meet you when
      the form goes down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Among other polite questions Tyler asked Seth where he was stopping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nowhere permanently. I must find some place. I stopped last night with
      Mr. Votts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With Mr. Votts, the gentleman who just left us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you mean Tom Watts. You&rsquo;ve got his name wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to think of it, it was a German who called him that last evening,
      and I was misled by his pronunciation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tyler&rsquo;s face grew more serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a stranger here. Let me give you some advice. Don&rsquo;t cultivate Mr.
      Watts&rsquo; German friends. He&rsquo;s not a bad chap of his sort, but he drinks
      altogether too much beer. Who drinks beer, thinks beer, as Johnson says.
      Perhaps I can be of use to you in the matter of a boarding house. Oh,
      here&rsquo;s Mur-tagh,&rdquo; he continued introducing Seth to another tall, slender
      young man who had come up the stairs with an arm-full of papers; &ldquo;he will
      take you now, and give you an idea of your work.&rdquo; Whereupon Mr. Tyler
      turned again to his papers and shears, and Seth followed the new comer to
      the farthest stall in the row, which was henceforth to be his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      There came a brief quarter of an hour in the afternoon when what seemed to
      the novice a state of the wildest excitement reigned in the editorial
      room. An inky boy in a huge leather apron dashed from stall to stall
      shouting an interrogative &ldquo;Thirty for you?&rdquo; His master and patron, the
      foreman, also aproned from chin to knees, with shirt-sleeves rolled to the
      biceps, followed with the same mysterious question, put in an injured and
      indignant tone. A loud, sharp discussion between this magnate and Tyler,
      profanely dictatorial on the one side, profanely satirical on the other,
      rose suddenly and filled the room with its clamor. An elderly man, bald as
      a billiard ball, and dressed like a clergyman, came bounding up the
      stairs, pulling out his watch as he advanced, and demanding fiercely the
      reason for this delay. There was an outburst of explanation, in which four
      or five voices joined, mingling personal abuse freely with their analysis
      of the situation. Tom Watts leaped up the stairs four steps at a time and
      hurled himself into the controversy. Seth could distinguish in this babel
      of exclamations such phrases as&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You better get some india-rubber chases!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that fire&rsquo;s cut down, you might as well not go to press at all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If somebody would get down here in the morning, we could get our matter
      up in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick and tired of getting out telegraph for these chuckle-headed
      printers to throw on the floor!&rdquo; &ldquo;That Mayhew matter&rsquo;s been standing on
      the galleys so long already that it&rsquo;s got grey-headed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the Lord Harry, I&rsquo;ll make a rule that the next time we miss the
      Wyoming mail it shall be taken out of your wages!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the inky boy galloped through to Seth with a proof-sheet, shouting,
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a minute and a half to read this in!&rdquo; The bald, elderly
      gentleman, who seemed to be Mr. Workman, came and stood over Seth, watch
      in hand, scowling impatiently. Under this embarrassment the wet letters
      danced before his eyes, and he could find no errors, though it turned out
      later that he had passed &ldquo;elephant&rdquo; for &ldquo;elopement&rdquo; and ruined Watts&rsquo;
      chief sensation. A few minutes later, the clang of the presses in the
      basement shook the old building, and the inky boy bustled through the room
      again, pitching a paper into each of the stalls. There was a moment of
      silence, broken only by the soft rustling of the damp sheets. Then
      simultaneously from the several tables rose a chorus of violent
      objurgation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seth heard the voice which he had learned was Samboye&rsquo;s roar out, &ldquo;What
      dash-dashed idiot has made me say &lsquo;our martyr President Abraham Sinclair?
      &rsquo; Stop the press!&rdquo; There were other voices: &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s two lines of
      markets upside down!&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, I say, this is <i>too</i> bad. <i>Moyen age</i>
      is &lsquo;mayonaise &rsquo; in my Shylock notice, and it&rsquo;s Mrs. McCullough
      instead of Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dashed if the paper looks as if it had been read at all. We can&rsquo;t
      have such proof-reading as this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While these comments were still proceeding the noise of the press suddenly
      ceased. The silence was terrible to Seth&rsquo;s guilty consciousness, for he
      had heard enough to know that it was his fault. Mr. Workman entered the
      room again, and again Sam-boye&rsquo;s deep voice was heard, repeating the awful
      Sinclair-Lincoln error. Seth had looked at his fresh copy of the <i>Chronicle</i>,
      with some vague hope that the Editor was mistaken, but alas! it was too
      true. Mr. Workman came over to his stall; he had put his watch back in his
      pocket, but his countenance was stern and unbending.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are Mr. Fairchild, I presume,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seth rose to his feet, blushing, and murmured, &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understood from your brother that you were used to newspaper work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I thought I was. I have been around the <i>Banner of Liberty</i>
      office a great deal, but it seems so different on a daily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&mdash;yes. Well, I dare say you&rsquo;ll learn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Luckily the press started up again here, and Mr. Workman, looking at his
      watch once more, went down stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seth felt most grievously depressed. Looking back, his first day had been
      full of mortification and failure. The use of scissors and mucilage brush
      was painfully unfamiliar to his clumsy fingers. The scope and intention of
      the various news departments he had been told to take charge of were
      unknown to him, and he had watched Murtagh go over the matter he
      submitted, striking out page after page, saying curtly, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had this,&rdquo;
       &ldquo;This is only worth a line or two,&rdquo; or &ldquo;this belongs in county notes,&rdquo;
       with a sinking heart. His duties were so mechanical and commonplace, after
      what he had conceived an editor&rsquo;s functions to be, that his ineptitude was
      doubly humiliating.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was this dreadful proof-reading failure. Murtagh had given him
      the sample proof-sheet in the back of the dictionary to copy his marks
      from&mdash;and he had copied them with such scrupulous efforts after
      exactness that the printers couldn&rsquo;t understand them. These printers&mdash;he
      could see them through the windows opposite, standing pensively over their
      tall cases, and moving their right arms between the frames and their
      sticks with the monotonous regularity of an engine&rsquo;s piston-rod&mdash;seemed
      a very sarcastic and disagreeable body of men, to judge by the messages of
      criticism on his system of marking which the inky boy had delivered for
      them with such fidelity and enjoyment during the day. He had eaten nothing
      since the early breakfast, and felt faint and tired. The rain outside,
      beating dismally on the window and the tin roof beyond, added to his
      gloom, and the ceaseless drumming of the presses below increased his
      headache.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other men seemed to have nothing to do now save to talk, but he turned
      wearily to the great mound of exchanges from which Murtagh had directed
      him to extract &ldquo;Society Jottings&rdquo; and &ldquo;Art, Music and the Drama&rdquo; after the
      paper went to press.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spent a few despairing minutes on the threshold of the task&mdash;enough
      to see clearly that it was beyond his strength. Society was Syriac to him,
      and he had never seen a play acted, beyond an occasional presentation of
      &ldquo;Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Octoroon&rdquo; by strolling tenth-rate mummers in
      the tiny hall at Thessaly. How could he select matter for such
      departments? He wavered for a time, from a disinclination to confront men
      who had just condemned his work so unsparingly, but at last he got up from
      the table where he had been pinned all day, and went over to the further
      end of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sort of conclave about Tyler&rsquo;s table. Both he and Samboye
      reclined in tipped-back chairs, with their feet upon it; Watts sat on the
      table swinging his legs, his straw hat still on the back of his head, and
      Murtagh was perched in the window seat. Their conversation, which had been
      flowing freely, stopped as Seth approached. He had expected to be
      introduced to his Editor, Mr. Samboye, but no one seemed to think of it,
      and that gentleman himself relieved him of the embarrassment by nodding
      not uncourteously but with formality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fairchild,&rdquo; he said, with impressive slowness, &ldquo;in the pursuit of a
      high career you will be powerfully aided by keeping in recollection the
      fact that the sixteenth President of the United States was named Lincoln
      and not Sinclair. We have a prejudice too, weak as it may seem, in favor
      of spelling &lsquo;interval&rsquo; with a &lsquo;v&rsquo; rather than an &lsquo;n&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth did not find it so difficult to address this great man as he had
      anticipated. He said simply that he was very sorry, but the work was
      utterly new to him, it was his first day, he hoped to learn soon, etc.
      Emboldened by the sound of his own voice, he added his doubts about being
      able to satisfactorily preside over such exacting columns as &ldquo;Society
      Jottings&rdquo; and &ldquo;Art, Music and the Drama&rdquo;&mdash;and gave reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George!&rdquo; cried Watts, &ldquo;I envy you! Just fancy a man who has never seen
      anything but &lsquo;Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin&rsquo;&mdash;and not even that with real
      Siberian bloodhounds. You shall begin going tonight. I&rsquo;ll take you to
      &lsquo;Muldoon&rsquo;s Picnic.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, at any rate,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Tyler, &ldquo;you can do &lsquo;Agricultural.&rsquo; You
      must know that right down to the ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; assented Seth, &ldquo;I think I ought to manage that. The truth is, most
      of the stuff the papers print for farmers is nonsense&mdash;pure rubbish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it is. I know that Dent&mdash;he is a New York city boy, who
      doesn&rsquo;t know clover from cabbage&mdash;once put in a paragraph about the
      importance of feeding chickens on rock salt, and an old farmer from Boltus
      came in early one morning and whaled the bookkeeper out of his boots
      because he had followed the advice and killed all his hens. There must be
      some funny man out West somewhere who makes up these bad agricultural
      paragraphs, and of course they get copied. How can fellows like Dent, for
      instance, tell which are good and which are not? But they can&rsquo;t fool you,
      and that&rsquo;ll be an advantage. Then there&rsquo;s Religious. You can do that
      easily enough. I should think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; interposed Murtagh, &ldquo;all you have to do is to lay for the Obago <i>Evening
      Mercury</i>. Every Saturday that has a column of religious. Alec Watson, a
      fellow in that office, has fifty-two of these columns, extracts from
      Thomas à Kempis, and Wesley and Spurgeon and that sort of thing, which
      have been running in the <i>Mercury</i> since before the war. When New
      Year&rsquo;s comes he starts &rsquo;em going again, round and round. Nobody
      knows the difference. Well, their columns are longer than ours, so each
      week you can run about half their paragraphs&mdash;the shortest ones&mdash;and
      then fill in with some news notes, statistics, you know, about how many
      churches the Moravians have now, and that sort of thing. You can pick
      those up during the week, anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there ought to be some originality about it too,&rdquo; said Tom Watts.
      &ldquo;It is just as well to sling in some items of your own, I think, such as
      &lsquo;There is a growing desire among the Baptists to have Bishops, like other
      people,&rsquo; or, &lsquo;It is understood that at the coming Consistory the Pope will
      create seven new American Cardinals.&rsquo; That last is a particularly good
      point. Every once in a while, predict more Cardinals. It doesn&rsquo;t hurt
      anybody, and it makes you solid when the thing does happen. There&rsquo;s
      nothing like original news to show the influence of journalism. One
      morning, after the cakes had been bad for a week, heavy, sour or something
      else, I said to my landlady that I believed the fault must be in the
      buckwheat. She said no, she didn&rsquo;t think so, for the flour looked very
      nice indeed. I put a line in &lsquo;Local Glimpses&rsquo; that day, saying that
      unfortunately the buckwheat this year was of inferior quality, and the
      very next morning she apologised to me: said I was right; the buckwheat <i>was</i>
      bad; she had read so in the <i>Chronicle</i>. Can you imagine a nobler
      illustration of the power of the press?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth looked attentively at the speaker, to see if he was joking, but there
      was no more evidence of mirth in his thin face than in the serious tone of
      his voice. None of the others laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Samboye said some of the most remarkable things, at once humorous and
      highly original, and put in an elaborate frame of big unusual words. He
      was a huge man in frame, with an enormous head, bushy eyebrows, heavy
      whiskers, a ponderous manner, a tremendous voice&mdash;in fact seemed to
      Seth precisely the kind of man from whom delicate wit, and soft shading of
      phrases were not to be expected. He happened for the nonce to be in a
      complaisant mood, and was relaxing himself in the company of &ldquo;his young
      men,&rdquo; as he liked to call his colleagues. But ordinarily he was
      overbearing and arbitrary, and this had rankled so deeply in their minds
      that they listened with apathy, unresponsive, to his choicest sallies, and
      Watts even combated him, with scant courtesy it seemed to Seth.
    </p>
    <p>
      To him this monologue of the Editor&rsquo;s was a revelation. He had never heard
      such brilliant talk, such a wonderful mastery of words, such delicious
      humor. He drank it all in eagerly, and laughed aloud at its broader points&mdash;the
      more heartily, perhaps, because no one else smiled. This display of
      appreciation bore fruit after its kind. Before Mr. Samboye went he spoke
      some decidedly gracious words to Seth, saying among other things:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However harshly we may be tempted by momentary stress of emotion to
      speak, always remember that we unitedly feel your fresh bucolic interest
      in things, your virginal capacity for admiration, and your pristine flush
      of enthusiasm for your work to be distinct acquisitions to the paper,&rdquo;
       which Seth felt to be somewhat nonsensical, but still was grateful for.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Mr. Samboye had gone, Tom Watts took occasion to warn him in an
      aside:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be careful how you appear to curry favor with Samboye before the other
      fellows. Oh, I know you didn&rsquo;t think of it&mdash;but don&rsquo;t laugh at his
      jokes. They&rsquo;ll think you&rsquo;re trying to climb over them, and they&rsquo;ll be
      unpleasant to you, perhaps.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XIII.&mdash;THIRTEEN MONTHS OF IT.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">G</span>ROWING familiarity
      with his work did not restore to Seth the lofty conceptions of
      journalism&rsquo;s duties and delights which he had nourished on the hill-side
      farm, and which had been so ingloriously dimmed and defaced by his first
      day&rsquo;s experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tasks set before him, to which he gradually became accustomed, seemed
      almost as unintellectual and mechanical as the ploughing and planting he
      had forsaken. The rule of condensation, compression, continually dinned
      into his ears by his mentors, robbed his labors of all possible charm. To
      &ldquo;boil down&rdquo; columns of narrative into a few lines of bald, cold statement;
      to chronicle day after day in the curtest form, fires, failures, crimes,
      disasters, deaths, in a wearying chain of uninteresting news notes; to
      throw remorselessly into the journalistic crucible all the work of
      imagination, of genius, of deep fine thought which came into his hands,
      together with the wordy dross spun out by the swarm of superficial
      scribblers, and extract from good and bad alike only the meaningless,
      miserable fact&mdash;this was a task against which, in the first weeks of
      experience, his whole soul revolted.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time he had become reconciled to it, and had mastered its tricks,
      his dream of journalism as the most exalted of all departments of activity
      seemed to him like some far-away fantasy of childhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      He not only had failed to draw inspiration from his work; it was already
      ceasing to interest him. Under pleasanter conditions, he felt that he
      would have at least liked the proof-reading portion of the daily routine;
      but the printers were so truculent and hostile, and seemed so
      pre-determined to treat him as their natural enemy, that this was irksome,
      too. There was no relief to the distasteful monotony in other branches of
      his work. Even the agricultural column, which he had promised himself to
      so vastly improve, yielded no satisfaction. The floating, valueless stuff
      from which his predecessors had selected their store came so easily and
      naturally to the scissors that after a week or two he abandoned the idea
      of preparing original matter: it saved time and labor, and nobody seemed
      to know the difference. These words, in fact, came to describe his mental
      attitude toward all his work. He had no pride in it. If he escaped curses
      for badly-read proofs, and criticism for missing obvious matters of news,
      it was enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seth did not arrive at this condition of mind without much inner protest,
      or without sundry efforts to break through the crust of perfunctory
      drudgery which was encasing him. At the start he bestowed considerable
      thought and work upon an effort to brighten and improve, by careful
      re-working of materials, one of the departments entrusted to him, and,
      just when he expected praise, Tyler told him to stop it. Then he tried to
      make his religious column a feature by discarding most of the ancient
      matter which revolved so drolly in the Obago <i>Evening Mercury</i>, and
      picking out eloquent bits from the sermons of great contemporary
      preachers; but this elicited denominational protest from certain pious
      subscribers, and Mr. Workman commanded a return to the old rut.
    </p>
    <p>
      But <i>the</i> cruel humiliation came when Seth took to Mr. Samboye an
      editorial paragraph he had written with great care. It was a political
      paragraph, and Seth felt confident that it was exactly in the <i>Chronicle&rsquo;s</i>
      line, and good writing as well. The Editor took it, after regarding the
      young writer with a stony, half-surprised stare, and read it over slowly.
      He delivered judgment upon it, in his habitual pomposity of phrases: &ldquo;This
      is markedly comprehensive in scope and clarified in expression, Mr.
      Fairchild.&rdquo; Then, as Seth&rsquo;s heart was warming with a sense of commendation
      and success, the Editor calmly tore the manuscript in strips, dropped them
      in his waste-basket, and turned reflectively to his newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seth&rsquo;s breath nearly left him: &ldquo;Then you can&rsquo;t use it;&rdquo; he faltered. &ldquo;I
      thought it might do for an editorial paragraph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was the faintest suggestion of a patronising smile on Mr. Samboye&rsquo;s
      broad, ruddy face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am reminded, Mr. Fairchild,&rdquo; he answered, with bland irrelevance;
      &ldquo;pray do not allow Porte to pass again with a small p, as you did
      yesterday in the proof of my Turkish article. It should be capitalized
      invariably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The beginner went back to his stall both humiliated and angry. The cool
      insolence with which he had been reminded that he was a proof-reader, and
      warned away from thoughts of the editorial page, enraged and depressed
      him. He passed a bitter hour at his table, looking savagely through the
      window at the automatic motions of the printer directly opposite, but
      thinking evil thoughts of Samboye, and cursing the fate which had led him
      into newspaper work. So uncomfortable did he make himself by these
      reflections that it required a real effort to throw off their effects when
      Watts came upstairs, and the two left the office for the day. It was
      impossible not to relate his grievance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom did not see its tragic side, and refused utterly to concede that Seth
      ought to be cast down by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s only Samboye&rsquo;s way,&rdquo; he said, lightly. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t let any of the
      fellows get on to the page, simply because he&rsquo;s afraid they&rsquo;ll outwrite
      him. He&rsquo;d rather do it all himself&mdash;and he does grind out an immense
      load of stuff&mdash;than encourage any rivals. Besides, he never loses a
      chance to snub youngsters. Don&rsquo;t let it worry you for a minute. If he sees
      that it does, he&rsquo;ll only pile it on the thicker. In this business you&rsquo;ve
      got to have a hide on you like the behemoth of Holy Writ, or you&rsquo;ll keep
      raw all the while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth found some consolation in this view, and more still in Tom&rsquo;s cheery
      tone. The two young men spent the evening together&mdash;at Bismarck&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      This came gradually but naturally to be Seth&rsquo;s habitual evening resort. It
      represented to him, indeed, all that was friendly and inviting in Tecumseh
      society. He was able to recall dimly some of the notions of coming social
      distinction he indulged in the farm days&mdash;dreams of a handsome young
      editor who was in great request in the most refined and luxurious home
      circles, who said the most charming things to beautiful young ladies at
      parties and balls, who wavered in his mind between wedding his employer&rsquo;s
      daughter and taking a share in the paper, or choosing some lowlier but
      more intellectual maid to wife, and leading with her a halcyon and
      exaltedly literary career in a cottage&mdash;but they were as unreal, as
      indistinct now as the dreams of night before last. All the social bars
      seemed drawn against him as a matter of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      This did not impress him as a hardship, because he was only vaguely
      conscious of it, at first, and then grew into the habit of regarding it as
      a thing to be grateful for. Tom Watts pointed out to him frequently the
      advantage of being a Bohemian, of being free from all the fearsome,
      undefined routine and responsibility of making calls, of dressing up in
      the evening, and of dangling supine attendance upon girls and their
      mammas. This &ldquo;social racket,&rdquo; the city editor said, might please some
      people; Dent, for instance, seemed to like it. But for his part it seemed
      quite the weakest thing a young man could go in for&mdash;entirely
      incompatible with the robust and masculine character demanded in a
      successful journalist.
    </p>
    <p>
      This presented itself to Seth as an extremely sound position, and he made
      it his own so willingly that very soon he began to take credit to himself
      in his own eyes for having turned a deaf ear to the social siren, and
      having deliberately rejected the advances of fashionable Tecumseh. He
      grew, really, to believe that it was by preference, by a wise resolution
      to preserve his freedom and individuality, that he remained outside the
      mysterious, impalpable regions which were labelled in his mind as
      &ldquo;Society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, there was no nonsense at Bismarck&rsquo;s, or at the other
      similar beer halls to which Tom introduced him. One dressed as one chose,
      and did as one liked; seven-up or penochle provided just the mental
      recreation a wearied literary brain demanded; and the fellows one met
      there were cheerful, companionable young men, who likewise had no nonsense
      about them, who put on no airs of superiority, and who glided swiftly and
      jovially through the grades of acquaintanceship to intimacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seth was greatly strengthened in his liking for this refuge from
      loneliness in a strange city by what he saw of Arthur Dent, whom Watts had
      prepared him to regard as the embodiment of the other and strait-laced
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      This young man was not at all uncivil, but he was delicate, almost
      effeminate in frame, wore eye-glasses, dressed with fastidious neatness,
      never made any jokes or laughed heartily at those of others, and rarely
      joined the daily lounge and smoke around Tyler&rsquo;s table after the paper had
      gone to press&mdash;and in all these things he grated upon Seth&rsquo;s
      sensitiveness. He was the one member of the staff whom Mr. Workman seemed
      to like and whom Mr. Samboye never humiliated publicly by his ponderous
      ridicule, and these were added grievances. He worked very steadily and
      carefully, and was said to do a good deal of heavy reading at home,
      evenings, in addition to the slavish routine of high social duties in
      which Seth indefinitely understood him to be immersed. His chief tasks
      were the book reviews, the editing of correspondence, and the preparation
      of minor editorial paragraphs in a smaller type than Mr. Samboye&rsquo;s. Seth
      thought that his style, though correct and neat, was thin and emasculated,
      and he came to associate this with his estimate of the writer, and account
      for it by his habits and associations&mdash;which the further confirmed
      him in his judgment as to the right way to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was something more than this. The first few days after his
      return from his vacation, Dent had tried to be courteous and helpful to
      the newcomer from the country, in his shy, undemonstrative way, and Seth,
      despite his preconceived prejudice, had gone a little way on the road to
      friendship. Then one night, as he and Watts were returning arm-in-arm to
      their joint lodgings from Bismarck&rsquo;s, a trifle unsteadily perhaps, they
      had encountered Dent walking with a young lady, and Tom had pleasantly
      accosted them&mdash;at least it seemed pleasantly to Seth&mdash;but Dent
      had not taken it in the right spirit at the time, and had been decidedly
      cool to Seth ever since. This was so unreasonable that the country boy
      resented it deeply, and the two barely spoke to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      His relations with the others were less strained, but scarcely more
      valuable in the way of companionship. Mr. Tyler did not seem to care much
      for his company, and never asked him to go to the &ldquo;Roast Beef&rdquo;&mdash;a
      sort of combination of club and saloon where he spent most of his
      evenings, where poker was the chief amusement and whisky the principal
      drink. From all Seth could learn, it was as well for him that he was not
      invited there. As for Murtagh, all his associations outside the office
      seemed to be with young men of his own race, who formed a coterie by
      themselves, and frequented distinctively Irish resorts. Like most other
      American cities Tecumseh had its large Irish and German elements, and in
      nothing were ethnographic lines drawn so clearly as in the matter of
      amusements. There were enough young Americans holding aloof from both
      these foreign circles to constitute a small constituency for the &ldquo;Roast
      Beef,&rdquo; but a far greater number had developed a liking for the German
      places of resort, and drank beer and ate cheese and rye bread as if to the
      manner born. Seth found himself in this class on his first step over the
      threshold of city life; he enjoyed it, and he saw very little of the
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two most important men on the <i>Chronicle</i>, Mr. Workman and Mr.
      Samboye, were far removed from the plane upon which all these Bohemian
      divisions were traced. They belonged to the Club&mdash;the Tuscarora Club.
      Seth knew where the club house was&mdash;but he felt that this was all he
      was ever likely to know about it. The first few days in Tecumseh had
      taught him the hopelessness of his dream of associating with his employer.
      Socially they were leagues apart at the outset, and if the distance did
      not increase as weeks grew into months, at least Seth&rsquo;s perception of it
      did, which amounted to the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not so readily abandon the idea of being made a companion by
      Samboye, but at last that vanished too. The Editor held himself very high,
      and if he occasionally came down off his mountain top, his return to those
      heights only served to emphasize their altitude. There were conflicting
      stories about his salary. Among the lesser lights of the editorial room it
      was commonly estimated at forty-five dollars a week, but some of the
      printers had information that it was at least fifty&mdash;which fatigued
      the imagination. Seth himself received nine dollars, which his brother
      supplemented by five, and he found that he was regarded as doing
      remarkably well for a beginner. But between this condition and the state
      of Samboye with his great income, his fine house on one of the best
      streets, his influential position in the city, and his luxurious
      amusements at the Club, an impassable gulf yawned.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no pleasure in following further the details of the country boy&rsquo;s
      new life. He lost sight of his disappointment in the consolations of a
      phase of city existence which does not show to advantage in polite-pages.
      He did not become vicious or depraved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The relentless treadmill of a daily paper forbade his becoming indolent.
      By sheer force of contact his mind expanded, too, more than even he
      suspected. But it was a formless, unprofitable expansion, which did not
      help him to get out of the rut. He performed his work acceptably&mdash;at
      least he rarely heard any criticisms upon it&mdash;lived a trifle ahead of
      his small income, and ceased to even speculate on the chance of promotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, thirteen months after his advent in Tecumseh, the news came to him
      from the farm that his father was dying, he obtained leave to go home. Mr.
      Workman remarked to Mr. Samboye that afternoon:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t mind much if Fairchild doesn&rsquo;t come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that so? He seems to get through his work decently and inoffensively
      enough. He will never set the North River ablaze, of course, but he is
      civil and all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I can&rsquo;t see that there&rsquo;s anything in him. Beside, I don&rsquo;t like
      his influence on Watts. I&rsquo;m told you can find them together at Bismarck&rsquo;s
      every night in the week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, that makes it bad,&rdquo; said Mr. Samboye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the proprietor and the editor locked up their desks, went over to the
      Club, and played pyramid pool till midnight.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV.&mdash;BACK ON THE FARM.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he farm seemed
      very little like home to Seth, now that he was back once more upon it. He
      could neither fit himself familiarly into such of the old ways as remained
      nor altogether appetize the changes which he felt rather than discerned
      about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all these alterations his father&rsquo;s disappearance was among the least
      important. Everybody had grown out of the habit of considering Lemuel as a
      factor in any question. Nobody missed him now that he was gone, or felt
      that it was specially incumbent to pretend to do so&mdash;nobody save Aunt
      Sabrina. Those who cared to look closely could see that the old maid was
      shaken by her weak brother&rsquo;s death, and that, though she said little or
      nothing about it, an augmented sense of loneliness preyed upon her mind.
      For the rest, the event imposed a day or two of solemnity, some
      alterations of dress and demeanor, a sombre journey with a few neighbors
      to the little burial plot beyond the orchard&mdash;and then things resumed
      their wonted aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the young journalist this aspect was strange and curious. The farm had
      put on a new guise to his eyes. It was as if some mighty hand and brush
      had painted it all over with bright colors. It was not only that the house
      had been restored and refurnished, that new spacious buildings replaced
      the ancient barns, that the fences had been rebuilt, the farm yard cleaned
      up and sodded, the old well-curb and reach removed&mdash;the very grass
      seemed greener, the bending of the boughs more graceful, the charm of sky
      and foliage and verdure far more apparent. The cattle were plumper and
      cleaner; there were carriage horses now, with bright harness and sweeping
      tails, and a costly black mare for the saddle, fleet as the wind: the food
      on the table was more uniformly toothsome, and there were now the broad
      silver-plated forks to which Seth had somewhat laboriously become
      accustomed in his Tecumseh boardinghouse. He admired all these changes, in
      a way, but somehow he could not feel at home among them. They were
      attractive, but they were alien to the memories which, in his crowded,
      bricked-up city solitude, had grown dear to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were droll changes among the hired people. For one thing, they no
      longer all ate at the table with the family. An exception was made in
      favor of Milton Squires, who had burst through the overalls chrysalis of
      hired-manhood, and had become a sort of superintendent. He had not learned
      to eat with a fork, and he still talked loudly and with boisterous
      familiarity at the table, reaching for whatever he wanted, and calling the
      proprietor &ldquo;Albert,&rdquo; and his aunt &ldquo;Sabriny.&rdquo; He did not bear his social
      and industrial promotion meekly. He bullied the inferior hired men&mdash;Leander
      had a colleague now, a rough, tow-headed, burly young fellow named Dana
      Pills-bury&mdash;and snubbed loftily the menials of the kitchen. This
      former haunt scarcely knew him more, and his rare conversations with
      Alvira were all distinctly framed in condescension. This was only to be
      expected, for Milton wore a black suit of store-clothes every day, with a
      gold-plated watch chain and a necktie, and met the farmers round about on
      terms of practical equality. He was reputed to be a careful and capable
      manager; his wrath was feared at the cheese-factory; his judgment was
      respected at the corners&rsquo; store. Naturally, such a man would feel himself
      above kitchen associations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course this defection evoked deep wrath in Alvira&rsquo;s part of the house,
      some overflowings of which came to Seth&rsquo;s notice before he had been a day
      at the farm. Alvira was not specially changed to the young man&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;indeed
      her sallow, bilious visage, dark snapping eyes and furrowed forehead
      seemed the most familiar things about the homestead, and her acidulous
      tones struck a truer note in his chords of memory than did any other
      sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Sabrina, wrapped as of old in her red plaid shoulder shawl, but
      seemingly less erect and aggressive, spent most of her time in the
      kitchen, ostentatiously pretending to pay her board by culinary labor.
      Behind her back Alvira was wont to say to her assistant, a slatternly
      young slip from the ever-spreading Lawton family tree, that the old lady
      only hindered the work, and that her room would be better than her
      company. But when Aunt Sabrina was present, Alvira was customarily civil,
      sometimes quite friendly. The two were drawn together by community of
      grievance.
    </p>
    <p>
      They both hated Isabel, with her citified notions, her forks and napkins,
      and stuck-up airs generally. It had pleased Aunt Sabrina&rsquo;s mood to regard
      herself as included in the edict which ordained that servants should eat
      in the kitchen, and only the sharpest words she had ever heard Albert
      speak had prevented her acting upon this. She had come to the family
      table, then, but always with an air of protest; and she had a grim
      pleasure in leaving her napkin unfolded, month after month, and in keeping
      everybody waiting while she paraded her inability to eat rapidly or
      satisfactorily with the new fangled &ldquo;split spoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She and Alvira had a never-failing topic of hostile talk in the new
      mistress. To judge by their threats, their jibes and their angry
      complaints, they were always on the point of leaving the house on her
      account. So imminent did an outbreak seem to Seth, when he first heard
      their joint budget of woes and bitter resolves, that he was frightened,
      but the Lawton girl reassured him. They had talked just like that, she
      said, every day since she had been there, which would be &ldquo;a year come
      August,&rdquo; and she added scornfully: &ldquo;They go away? You couldn&rsquo;t chase &rsquo;em
      away with a clothes-pole!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two elderly females had another bond of sympathy, of course, in
      Milton&rsquo;s affectation of superiority.
    </p>
    <p>
      They debated this continually, though as Sabrina had the most to say about
      her niece-in-law, with Alvira as a sympathetic commentator, so the hateful
      apotheosis of the whilom hired-man was recognized to be Alvira&rsquo;s special
      and personal grievance, in girding at which Sabrina bore only a helping
      part.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seth accounted for this by calling up in recollection an old vague
      understanding of his youth that Milton was some time going to marry
      Alvira. He could remember having heard this union spoken of as taken for
      granted in the family. Doubtless Alvira&rsquo;s present attitude of ugly
      criticism was due to the fear that Milton&rsquo;s improved prospects would lead
      him elsewhere. The Lawton girl indeed hinted rather broadly to him that
      there were substantial grounds for Alvira&rsquo;s rage. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d tear his eyes out
      if I was her, and he wouldn&rsquo;t come up to the scratch,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;after
      all that&rsquo;s happened.&rdquo; Seth understood her suggestion, but he didn&rsquo;t
      believe it. The Lawtons were a low-down race, anyway. He had seen one of
      the girls at Tecumseh once, a girl who had gone utterly to the bad, and
      this sister of hers seemed a bold, rude huzzy, with a mind prone to mean
      suspicions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a relief to go back again to the living-room, where Isabel was, and
      he both verbally and mentally justified her gentle hint that the kitchen
      was not a good place for young men to spend their time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no idea,&rdquo; she said, letting her embroidery fall in her lap for
      the moment, &ldquo;how ruinous to discipline and to household management
      generally this country plan of making companions of your servants is. I
      had to put a complete stop to it, very soon after I came. There would be
      no living with them otherwise. There&rsquo;s not much comfort in living with
      them as it is, for your Aunt sits out in the kitchen all day long,
      pretending that she is abused and encouraging them to think that they are
      ill-used too. She makes it very hard for me&mdash;harping all the time on
      my being a Richardson, just as she did with your mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s Milton. I did not want to make any difference between him
      and the other hired people, but your brother insisted on it&mdash;on
      having him at the table with us, and treating him like an equal. He is as
      coarse and rough and horrid as he can be, but it seems that he is very
      necessary on the farm, and your brother leaves so much to him and relies
      so much on him that I couldn&rsquo;t help myself. He hasn&rsquo;t got to calling me
      &lsquo;Isabel&rsquo; yet, but I expect him to begin every day of my life. You can&rsquo;t
      imagine what an infliction it is to see him eat&mdash;or rather, to hear
      him, for I try not to look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel took up her work again, and Seth looked at her more closely than he
      had done before. She sat at the window, with the full summer light on her
      bright hair and fair, pretty face. Her tone had been melancholy, almost
      mournful; looking at her, Seth felt that she was not happy, and more&mdash;for
      he had never supposed her to be particularly happy&mdash;that she was
      bitterly disappointed with the result of the farm experiment. She had not
      said so, however, and he was in doubt whether it would be wise for him to
      assume it in his conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Albert seems to thrive on country fare,&rdquo; he said, perhaps unconsciously
      suggesting in his remark what was turning in his mind&mdash;that she
      herself seemed not have thrived. The rounded outlines of her chin and
      throat were not so perfect as he remembered them. She looked thin and
      tired now, in the strong light, and there was no color to speak of in her
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; she said, with that falling inflection which is sister to the
      sigh, and keeping her eyes bent upon her work, &ldquo;<i>he</i> grows fat. I did
      not imagine that a man who had always been so active, who was so
      accustomed to regular office work and intellectual professional pursuits,
      could fall into idle ways so easily. But it is always a bore to him now
      when he has to go down to New York at term time. Once or twice he has had
      a coolness with his partners because he failed to go at all. I shouldn&rsquo;t
      be surprised if he gave New York up altogether. He talks often of it&mdash;of
      practising at Tecumseh instead. Oh, and that reminds me. You can tell.
      What relation does Tecumseh bear to this place? I know they have some
      connection in his mind, because he spoke once of the &lsquo;pull&rsquo;&mdash;whatever
      that may mean&mdash;being a Tecumseh lawyer would give him here. I know
      they are not in the same county, for I looked on the map. Whatever it is,
      that would be his purpose in going there, I am curious to learn. You
      know,&rdquo; she added, with a smile and tone pathetic in their sarcasm, &ldquo;a wife
      ought to be interested in whatever concerns her husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are in the same Congressional district,&rdquo; Seth replied. &ldquo;There are
      three counties in the district, Dearborn (where we are now), Jay, which
      lies east of us, and then Adams, which is a long, narrow county, and runs
      off South of Dearborn. Tecumseh is away at the extreme southern end of
      Adams county. Perhaps that is what you have in mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is what <i>he</i> has in mind,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how does Albert fill his time here&mdash;what does he do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In about equal parts,&rdquo; she made answer, lifting her eyes again, with the
      light of a little smile in them now, &ldquo;he reads novels here in the house,
      and drives about the neighborhood. What time he is not in the easy-chair
      upstairs, devouring fiction, he is in his buggy on the road. He won&rsquo;t let
      me have anybody up from New York, even of the few I know, but he has
      developed a wonderful taste for striking up acquaintances here. He must by
      this time know every farmer for twenty miles around. First of all, in
      buying his stock when he took the farm, he spread his purchases around in
      the queerest way&mdash;getting a cow from this man, a colt from another, a
      pig here and a bull there. Milton and he went together, and they must have
      driven two hundred miles, I should think, collecting the various animals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t understand it at first, but I begin to now. He wanted to
      establish relations with as many men here as he could. And the farmers he
      invites here to dinner&mdash;you should see them! Sometimes I think I
      shall have to leave the table. It&rsquo;s all I can do, often, to be decently
      civil to them, rough, vulgar men, unwashed and untidy, whom he waylays out
      on the road and brings in. He thinks I ought to exert myself to make them
      feel at home, and chat with them about their wives and children, and ugh!
      call on them and form friendships with them. But I draw the line there. If
      he enjoys bringing them here, why I can&rsquo;t help it; and if he likes to
      drive about, and be hail-fellow-well-met with them, that is his own
      affair. But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped, and Seth felt that the silence was eloquent. He began to
      realize that his pretty sister-in-law was in need of sympathy, and to rank
      himself, with indignant fervor, on her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annie Fairchild came in. Seth had seen and spoken with her several times,
      during the period of his father&rsquo;s death and funeral, but hurriedly and in
      the presence of others. Her appearance now recalled instantly the day of
      the fishing trip&mdash;a soft and pleasant memory, which during his year&rsquo;s
      exile had at times been truly delicious to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The women thought of it too, now, and talked of it, at Seth rather than to
      him, and with a playful spirit of badinage. As of old, Isabel did most of
      the talking. Annie had become quite a woman, Seth said to himself, as she
      took off her hat, tidied her hair before the glass, and laughingly joined
      in the conversation. She talked very well, too, but she seemed always to
      think over her words, and there appeared to be in her manner toward him a
      certain something, intangible, indefinite, which suggested constraint. He
      could feel, though he could not explain, it.
    </p>
    <p>
      During his stay in Tecumseh he had seen almost nothing of the other sex.
      There were often some young women at the boarding-house, but he had not
      got beyond a speaking acquaintance at the table with any of them, in the
      few instances where his shyness had permitted even that. His year in a
      city had improved him in many ways. He could wear good clothes now without
      awkwardness; he spoke readily among men, and with excellent choice of
      language; he knew how to joke without leading the laughter himself. But he
      had had no chance to overcome by usage his diffidence in female company,
      and he had not been quite at ease in his mind since Annie came in. She
      seemed to make a stranger of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought upon this, and felt piqued at it. He wondered, too if he was
      not sitting clumsily in his chair&mdash;if it was not impolite in him to
      cross his legs. Gradually, however, he grew out of his reserve. It dawned
      upon him that Annie was timorous, nervous, about the impression she was
      making on him, and that Isabel listened with real respect and deference to
      what he had to say. He grew bold, and took the lead of the conversation,
      and the two women followed meekly. It was a delightful sensation. He said
      to himself: &ldquo;It is the easiest thing in the world, once you make the
      plunge. I could talk with women now in the finest drawing room in the
      land.&rdquo; He sat back in his chair, and told them some anecdotes about Mr.
      Samboye, from which somehow they gathered the notion that he was at the
      best coordinate in rank with Seth. They were more than ever proud of their
      relative, who had so rapidly conquered a high and commanding position for
      himself in that mystic, awesome sphere of journalism. Seth expanded and
      basked in this admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had heretofore found the evenings on the farm stupidly tedious. To sit
      at the big table till bed time, reading by the light of a single kerosene
      lamp, or exchanging dry monosyllables with Albert, offered a dismal
      contrast to the cheerful street lamps, the bright store-windows, the noise
      and gaiety and life of the places of evening resort in Tecumseh. But this
      evening revealed a far more attractive side of country life than he had
      known before. Annie stayed after tea, and the three played dominoes.
      Albert seemed somewhat out of sorts, but they did not mind his silence in
      the least. They chatted gaily over their games, and time flew so merrily
      and swiftly, that Seth was surprised when Annie said she must leave, and
      he discovered that it was a quarter to ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How pleasantly the evening has passed,&rdquo; Isabel said, and smiled at him,
      and Annie answered, &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t it! I don&rsquo;t know when I have enjoyed myself so
      much&mdash;&rdquo; and she, too, smiled at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old walk over the fields, down the poplar lane, to see Annie home&mdash;how
      like the old times it seemed! And yet how far away they were! Sometimes in
      these bye-gone walks, as they came up now in Seth&rsquo;s memory, he and Annie
      had been almost like lovers&mdash;not indeed, in words, but in that
      magnetic language which the moon inspires. It occurred to neither of them
      to saunter slowly, now. They walked straight ahead, and there were no
      &ldquo;flashes of eloquent silence.&rdquo; Their conversation was all of Isabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not as happy as she expected!&rdquo; said Annie, repeating a question of
      Seth&rsquo;s; &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t guess how wretched she is! Sometimes it&rsquo;s all she can
      do to keep from breaking down. I am literally the only person she has to
      talk to, that she cares about, week in and week out. Albert is away a
      great deal. I don&rsquo;t think he is much company when he <i>is</i> home. She
      did try, when she first came, to make some acquaintances round about,
      among the well-to-do farmers&rsquo; wives. But she couldn&rsquo;t bear them, and they
      said she was stuck up, and so <i>that</i> came to nothing. She doesn&rsquo;t get
      on at all with Aunt Sabrina, either. Poor girl! she is so blue at times
      that my heart aches for her. Of course she wouldn&rsquo;t let you see it.
      Besides she has been ever so much more cheerful since you came. I <i>do</i>
      hope you will stay as long as you can&mdash;just for <i>her</i> sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She added this explanation with what sounded to Seth&rsquo;s ear like gratuitous
      emphasis. The disposition rose swiftly within him to resent this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very careful,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to have me understand that it&rsquo;s for her
      sake you want me to stay.&rdquo; Then he felt, even while the sound of his voice
      was in the air, that he had made a fool of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      His cousin did not accept the individual challenge. &ldquo;No, of course we are
      all glad to see you. You know we are. But <i>she</i> specially needs
      company; it&rsquo;s a mercy to her to have somebody to brighten her up a little.
      Really, I get anxious about her at times. I try to run over as much as I
      can, but then I have grandmother to tend, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is the old lady, by the way? And oh&mdash;tell me, Annie, what it was
      that all at once set her against me so. You remember&mdash;the day before
      we went fishing, and Isabel saved my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer did not come immediately. In the dim starlight Seth could see
      that his cousin&rsquo;s face was turned away, and he guessed rather than saw
      that she was agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you,&rdquo; she said at last, nervously, &ldquo;why grandmother&mdash;or,
      no, I will <i>not</i> tell you! You have no right to ask. Don&rsquo;t come any
      further, I am near enough to the house now. Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had hurried away from him. He watched her disappear in the darkness,
      then turned and walked meditatively home.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not so sure as he had been that it was easy to understand women.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV.&mdash;MR. RICHARD ANSDELL.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was no light
      task to spend a vacation contentedly on the farm. There were thousands of
      city people who did it, and seemed to enjoy it, but Seth found it
      difficult to understand how they contrived to occupy themselves. What work
      on a farm meant, he knew very well; but the trick of idling in the country
      was beyond him. It was too hot, in these July days, for driving much, and
      besides, Albert rarely invited him into the buggy when the grays were
      brought around to the step. The two brothers saw little of each other, in
      fact. It was not precisely a coolness, but Albert seemed to have other
      things on his mind beside fraternal entertainment. The old pastime of
      fishing, too, failed him. In the renovation of the house his fine pole and
      tackle had somehow disappeared, and he had no money wherewith to replace
      them. He had entered upon his vacation unexpectedly, at a time when he
      happened to be particularly short of cash&mdash;and there was something in
      Albert&rsquo;s manner and tone which rendered it impossible to apply to him,
      even if pride had not forbidden it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, it is true, the increasing delight of being in Isabel&rsquo;s
      company, but alongside this delight grew a doubt&mdash;a doubt which the
      young man shrank from recognizing and debating, but which forced its
      presence upon his mind, none the less&mdash;a doubt whether it was the
      part of wisdom to encourage too much of a friendship with his
      sister-in-law. This friendship had already reached a stage where Aunt
      Sabrina sniffed at its existence, and she hinted dimly to Seth of the
      perils which lurked in the lures of a citified siren, with an expression
      of face and a pointedness of emphasis which clearly had a domestic
      application. There was nothing in this, of course, but the insensate
      meddlesomeness of a disagreeable old maid, Seth said to himself, but still
      it annoyed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      More serious, though, was his suspicion&mdash;lying dormant sometimes for
      days, then suddenly awakened by a curt word or an intent glance&mdash;that
      Albert disliked to see him so much with Isabel. Often this rendered him
      extremely nervous, for Isabel had no discretion (so the young man put it
      to himself) and displayed her pleasure in his society, her liking for him,
      quite as freely in her husband&rsquo;s presence as when they were alone. There
      was nothing in this, either, only that it made him uneasy. Hence it came
      about that, just when one set of inclinations most urgently prompted him
      to stay about the house, another set often prevailed upon him to absent
      himself. On these occasions he generally walked over to Thessaly, and
      chatted with John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John and I have so much to talk about, you know, being both newspaper
      men,&rdquo; he used to say, with a feeling that he owed an explanation of some
      sort to Isabel. &ldquo;And then I can see the daily papers there. That gets to
      be a necessity with a journalist&mdash;as much so as his breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I scarcely dare to read a paper now,&rdquo; Isabel once replied. &ldquo;It drives me
      nearly mad with longing to get back among people again. I only read heavy
      things, classic poetry and history&mdash;and then, thank Heaven, there is
      this embroidery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was at John&rsquo;s, or rather on the way there, that Seth met one day a man
      of whom he was in after life accustomed to say, &ldquo;He altered the whole bent
      of my career.&rdquo; Perhaps this was an exaggerated estimate of the service
      Richard Ansdell really rendered Seth; but it is so difficult, looking
      back, to truly define the influence upon our fortunes or minds by any
      isolated event or acquaintance, and moreover, gratitude is so wholesome
      and sweet a thing to contemplate, and the race devotes so much energy to
      civilizing it out of young breasts, that I have not the heart to insist
      upon any qualification of Seth&rsquo;s judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ansdell at this time was nearly forty years of age, and looked to be
      under thirty. He was small, thin-faced, clean-shaven, dark of skin and
      hair, with full, clear eyes, that by their calmness of expression
      curiously modified the idea of nervousness which his actions and mode of
      speech gave forth. He was spending his fortnight&rsquo;s vacation in the
      vicinity, and he was strolling with his friend the school-teacher, Reuben
      Tracy, toward the village when Seth overtook them. Seth and Reuben had
      been very intimate in the old farm days&mdash;and <i>here</i> was a young
      man to the latent influence of whose sobriety of mind and cleanliness of
      tastes he never fully realized his obligation&mdash;but since his return
      they had not met. After greetings had been exchanged, they walked together
      to the village, and to the <i>Banner of Liberty</i> office.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the beginning of the week, and publication day was far enough off
      to enable John to devote all his time to his visitors. There was an hour
      or more of talk&mdash;on politics, county affairs, the news in the city
      papers, the humors and trials of conducting a rural newspaper, and so
      forth. When they rose to go, John put on his hat, and said he would &ldquo;walk
      a ways&rdquo; with them. On the street he held Seth back with a whispered &ldquo;Let
      us keep behind a bit, I want to talk to you.&rdquo; Then he added, when the
      others were out of hearing:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have got some personal things to say, later on. But&mdash;first of all&mdash;has
      Albert said anything since to you about the farm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have been thinking it all over, trying to see where the
      crookedness comes in&mdash;for I feel it in my bones that there <i>is</i>
      something crooked. But I am not lawyer enough to get on to it. I&rsquo;ve had a
      notion of putting the whole case to Ansdell, who&rsquo;s a mighty bright lawyer,
      but then again, it seems to be a sort of family thing that we ought to
      keep to ourselves. What do you think?&mdash;for after all, it is mostly
      your affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see that Albert isn&rsquo;t playing fair. It must be pretty nearly as
      he says&mdash;that he has put as much money in the farm as it was worth
      when he took it. It&rsquo;s true that father&rsquo;s will leaves it to him outright&mdash;and
      that wasn&rsquo;t quite as Albert gave us to understand it should be&mdash;but
      Albert pledges us that our rights in it shall be respected, and it seems
      to me that that is better than an acknowledged interest in a bankrupt farm
      would be, which we hadn&rsquo;t the capital to work, and which was worthless
      without it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you are right.&rdquo; John paused for a moment, then began again in a
      graver tone: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something else. How are you getting on on the <i>Chronicle?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well enough; I get through my work without anybody&rsquo;s finding fault. I
      suppose that is the best test. A fellow can&rsquo;t do any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is where you are wrong. &lsquo;A fellow&rsquo; can do a great deal more. And
      when you went there I, for one, expected you were going to do a deuced
      sight more. You have been there now&mdash;let&rsquo;s see&mdash;thirteen months.
      You are doing what you did when you went there&mdash;sawing up miscellany,
      boiling down news notes, grinding out a lot of departments which the
      office boy might do, if his own work weren&rsquo;t more important. In a word
      you&rsquo;ve just gone on to the threshold, and you&rsquo;ve screwed yourself down to
      the floor there&mdash;and from all I hear you are likely to stay there all
      your life, while other fellows climb over your head to get into the real
      places.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From all you <i>hear?</i> What do you mean by that&mdash;who&rsquo;s been
      telling you about me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you shan&rsquo;t know, my boy. It is enough that I <i>have</i> heard. You
      haven&rsquo;t fulfilled your promise. I thought you had the makings of a big man
      in you; I believed that all you needed was the chance, and you would rise.
      You were given the chance&mdash;put right in on the ground floor, and
      there you are, just where you were put. You haven&rsquo;t risen worth a cent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you expect a fellow to do? Get to be editor-in-chief in thirteen
      months? What could I do that I haven&rsquo;t done? There have been no vacancies,
      so no one has climbed over my head. I&rsquo;ve done the work I was set to do&mdash;and
      done it well, too. What more can you ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth spoke in an aggrieved tone, for this attack seemed as unjust as it
      had been unexpected.
    </p>
    <p>
      John replied, &ldquo;Now keep cool, youngster! Nobody expected you to get to be
      editor-in-chief in thirteen months, so don&rsquo;t talk nonsense. And I am not
      blaming you for not getting promotion, when there have been no vacancies.
      What I do mean, if you want to know, is that you have failed to make a
      good impression. You are not in the line of promotion. Workman doesn&rsquo;t say
      to himself when he thinks of you &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a smart, steady, capable young
      man on whom we can count, who&rsquo;s able to go as high as we are able to put
      him.&rsquo; No! instead of that he says&mdash;but no, never mind. I don&rsquo;t want
      to hurt your feelings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you are mighty considerate, all at once,&rdquo; retorted Seth, angrily. &ldquo;Go
      on! Say what you were going to say! What is it that Workman says, since
      you&rsquo;ve been spying on me behind my back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you are talking like a fool,&rdquo; said the elder brother, keeping his
      temper. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been spying on you. I have only been commenting on
      facts which have come to my knowledge without seeking and which were
      brought to me by one who has your interests at heart. I have only been
      talking to you as I ought to talk, with the sole idea of benefiting you,
      helping you. If you don&rsquo;t want to hear me, why I can shut up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth did not reply for a minute or so; then he growled moodily: &ldquo;Go ahead!
      Let&rsquo;s hear it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The &lsquo;all&rsquo; can be said in a few words. You have been wasting your time. I
      grant that you have done your work well enough to escape blame&mdash;but
      what credit is there in that? a million mechanics do that every day.
      Instead of improving yourself, elevating and polishing yourself, by good
      reading, by studying the art of writing, above all by choosing your
      associates among men who are your superiors, and from whom you can learn,
      you have settled down in a Dutch beer saloon, making associates out of the
      commonest people in town, and having for your particular chum that
      rattle-headed loafer Tom Watts. Do you suppose Mr. Workman doesn&rsquo;t know
      this? Do you suppose he likes it, or that it encourages him to hope for
      your future?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth was silent longer than ever, this time. When he spoke it was to utter
      something which he instantly regretted: &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been able to gather
      from your old friends that you were altogether a bigot, yourself, on the
      subject of beer, when you were my age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately John did not get angry; Seth honestly admired and envied his
      elder brother&rsquo;s good temper as he heard the reply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s neither here nor there. Perhaps I did a good many things that I
      want you to avoid. Besides, there was nothing in me. I am good enough as
      far as I go, but if I had worked on a daily paper till my teeth all fell
      out, I should never have got any higher than I was. With you it is
      different; you can go up to the head of the class if you are a mind to.
      But the beer saloon isn&rsquo;t the way&mdash;and Tom Watts isn&rsquo;t the guide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the only friend I have got. What was I to do? It is easy enough to
      talk, John, about my knowing good people and all that, but <i>how?</i>
      That is the question? It isn&rsquo;t fair to blame me as you do. All the men
      like Workman and Samboye&mdash;I suppose you mean them&mdash;hold
      themselves miles above me. Do you suppose I&rsquo;ve ever seen the inside of
      their houses or of their club? Not I! You dump a young countryman in a
      strange city, new at his work, without knowing a solitary soul&mdash;and
      then you complain because he gets lonesome, and makes friends with the
      only people who show any disposition to be friendly with him. Do you call
      that fair play?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s something in that,&rdquo; John replied, meditatively. &ldquo;Some time
      I&rsquo;m going to write a leader on the organized indifference of modern city
      society to what becomes of young men who deserve its good offices and
      drift into beer saloons because they are not forthcoming. It would make
      the <i>Banner</i> immensely solid with orthodox people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t have wanted me to go to the Young Men&rsquo;s Christian
      Association, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o, I don&rsquo;t know that I would. I don&rsquo;t know, after all, that you could
      have done much differently. But you&rsquo;ve done enough of it, do you
      understand? You have served your time; you have taken your diploma. It is
      time now to quit. And I can put you on to a man, now, who will help you on
      the other tack. Do you see Ansdell, ahead there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes;&mdash;is he the man who told you about Workman and me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John ignored the question. &ldquo;Ansdell is one of the cleverest men going;
      he&rsquo;s head and shoulders over anybody else there is in Tecumseh, or in this
      part of the State. For you to know him will be a college education in
      itself. He is more than a big lawyer, he is a student and thinker; more
      than that, he is a reformer; best of all, he is a man of the world, who
      has sown more wild oats than would fill Albert&rsquo;s new bins, and there&rsquo;s not
      an atom of nonsense about him. He knows about you. We&rsquo;ve talked you over
      together. He understands my idea of what you ought to be, and he can help
      you more than any other man alive&mdash;and what is more he will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was he who told you about me, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Seth persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will know, it was and it wasn&rsquo;t. All he said was that he had heard
      Workman speak of you; that he had got the idea from his tone that you were
      not making the most of your opportunities; that he thought this was a
      great pity; and that if he could be of any use to you he would be very
      glad. That is all&mdash;and not even your sulkiness can make anything but
      kindness out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This practically ended the dialogue, for the others had stopped to let the
      brothers come up, and John shortly after left the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three men had a long stroll back to the hillside road, with a still
      longer lounge on the grass under the elms by the bridge. Seth watched and
      listened to this swarthy, boyish-looking mentor who had, so to speak,
      thrust himself upon him, very closely, as was natural. Did he like him? It
      was hard, he found, to determine. Mr. Ansdell was extremely opinionated.
      He seemed to have convictions on almost every subject, and he clung to
      them, defended them, expanded them, with almost tearful earnestness. His
      voice was as strong and powerful as his figure was diminutive; he talked
      now chiefly about the Tariff, which he denounced with a vibrating
      intensity of feeling. Seth knew nothing about the Tariff, or next to
      nothing, but he admired what Ansdell said, mainly because it was said so
      well. But he grew quite enthusiastic in his endorsement when he heard his
      Editor, Mr. Samboye, used as a typical illustration of the dishonesty with
      which public men treated that question. After that he felt that it would
      be easy to make friends with Mr. Ansdell.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI.&mdash;DEAR ISABEL.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was the last day
      but one of Seth&rsquo;s vacation on the farm. He was not sorry, although the
      last week, by comparison, had been pleasant enough. He had seen a good
      deal of Mr. Ansdell, who interested him extremely, and who had come for
      him three or four times for long walks in the fields. He sat now in the
      living room near Isabel, dividing his attention between her and his book&mdash;one
      of Albert&rsquo;s innumerable novels. The desultory conversation mixed itself up
      with the unfolding work of fiction so persistently that he presently gave
      over the attempt to read, and drew his chair nearer to his sister-in-law.
      It was raining outside, and wet weather always made her want to talk. She
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, Seth, if you have noticed any change in Alvira.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t say that I have. In fact, she seems to me the one person
      about the place who has <i>not</i> altered a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See what eyes men have! Why, she has grown ages older. She goes about now
      muttering to herself like an old, old woman. And the way she looks at one,
      sometimes, it is enough to give one the chills. I tell Albert often that I
      am almost afraid to have her in the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth chuckled audibly, in good-natured derision. &ldquo;What a mountain out of a
      mole hill! Why Alvira has glared at people that way, with her little
      black-bead eyes, ever since I was a boy. She doesn&rsquo;t mean anything by it,&mdash;not
      the least in the world. The trouble is, Isabel, that you let your
      imagination run away with you. You are desperately lonesome here, and you
      amuse yourself by conjuring up all sorts of tragic things. You will have
      Aunt Sabrina a professional witch next thing you know, and Milton a mystic
      conspirator, and this plain old clap-boarded farm house a castle of
      enchantment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had never before assumed even this jocose air of superiority over his
      blond sister-in-law, and he closed his sentence in some little trepidation
      lest she should resent it. But no, she received it with meekness, and only
      protested mildly against the assumption underneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am sure there is something in it. She is brooding about Milton. Not
      in any sentimental way, you know, but it used to be understood, I think,
      that they were to marry, and now he carries himself way above her. Why, I
      can remember, as long ago as when I visited here that summer, when we were
      all boys and girls and cousins together, I heard your mother say they
      would make a match of it some time. But now he avoids the kitchen and her.
      It sounds ridiculous, doesn&rsquo;t it, for me to be speculating in this way
      about the love affairs of the servants. But you are driven to it here. You
      have no idea how grateful one gets to be, here in the country, for the
      smallest item of human gossip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth was still considering whether it was possible for him, in careful
      language, to suggest his own&mdash;or rather the Lawton girl&rsquo;s&mdash;view
      of the Milton-Alvira affair, when Isabel spoke again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking of gossip, there is something I have been tempted half a dozen
      times to mention to you&mdash;something I heard almost every day during
      the little time that the women round-about were calling on me. You will
      guess what I mean&mdash;the talk about you and Annie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth did not immediately answer, and she continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, you know, Seth, that I wouldn&rsquo;t speak of it if I thought it
      would be distasteful to you. But I know it used to be the idea that you
      two were marked for each other. I have heard ever so much about it since
      we have lived here. And yet you don&rsquo;t seem to me to be at all like lovers&mdash;hardly
      even like affectionate cousins. I think she has rather avoided the house
      since you have been here, although that, of course, may be only
      imagination. She is such a dear, good girl, and I am <i>so</i> fond of
      her, but still I can hardly imagine her as your wife. You don&rsquo;t mind my
      speaking about it, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth was still at a loss what to say, or, better, how to say it. While she
      had been speaking the contrast between the two young women, which had been
      slumbering in his mind for a year, had risen vividly before him. The
      smile, half-deprecating, half-inviting, with which she looked this last
      question at him, as she laid the everlasting embroidery down, and leaned
      slightly forward for a reply, gave the final touch to his vanishing
      doubts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind <i>your</i> speaking about it? No, no, Isabel.&rdquo; He scarcely knew his
      own voice, it was so full of cooing softness. &ldquo;I am glad you did&mdash;for&mdash;for
      who has a better right? No, there is nothing in the gossip. Our people&mdash;my
      mother, her grandmother&mdash;had it in mind once, I believe, but Annie
      and I have never so much as hinted at it between ourselves. Ever since
      mother&rsquo;s death old Mrs. Warren has, however, taken a deep dislike to me&mdash;you
      remember how she forbade Annie to go with us on that fishing trip&mdash;but
      even without that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I shan&rsquo;t forget that fishing trip,&rdquo; Isabel whispered, still with the
      tender smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I, you may be very sure.&rdquo; The caressing tone of his voice sounded
      natural to him now. &ldquo;As I was saying, even if we two young people had once
      thought of the thing, I fancy it would be different now, anyway. <i>Then</i>,
      I was going to be a farmer. <i>Now</i>, of course, that is all changed. My
      career is in the city, in circles where Annie would not be at home. She is
      a dear, good girl, as you say: nobody knows that better than I do. But you
      must admit she <i>is</i>&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;rural. Now that I
      have got my foot on the ladder, there is no telling how far I may not
      climb. It would be simply suicide to marry a wife whom I perhaps would
      have to carry up with me, a dead weight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The youngster was not in the least conscious of the vicious nonsense he
      was talking. In the magnetic penumbra of Isabel&rsquo;s presence his words
      seemed surcharged with wisdom and good feeling. And the young woman, too,
      who was four years his senior, and who should have known better, never
      suspected the ridiculous aspect of the sentiments to the expression of
      which she listened with such sweet-faced sympathy. We <i>are</i> such
      fools upon occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, there is no reason why I should think of marriage at all, for a
      long time to come&mdash;at least not until I have made my way up in my
      profession a bit. When the time does come, it will be because I have found
      my ideal&mdash;for I have an ideal, you know, a very exalted one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her keenly, blushing as he did so, to discover if she had
      caught the purport of his words; then he addressed himself, with an
      absence of verbal awkwardness at which he was himself astonished, to
      making it more clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, Isabel, that my brother has won a prize which would make anything
      less valuable seem altogether worthless in my eyes. If there is not
      another woman in the world like my brother Albert&rsquo;s wife, then I shall
      never marry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother Albert&rsquo;s wife&rdquo; looked up at the speaker for an instant&mdash;a
      glance which seemed to him to be made of smiles, sadness, delight,
      reproach and many other unutterable things; then she bent over her work,
      and he fancied that the pretty fingers trembled a little between the
      stitches. There was a minute of silence, which seemed a half hour. At last
      she spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does your brother impress you as being a particularly happy man? I won&rsquo;t
      ask a similar question about his wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth found it necessary to stand up, to do this subject justice. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he
      answered. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t deserve such a wife. But because one man is
      incapable of appreciating a treasure which he has won, it&rsquo;s no reason why
      another man shouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;shouldn&rsquo;t say to himself &lsquo;I will either marry
      that kind of woman or I&rsquo;ll marry none.&rsquo; Now, <i>is</i> it, Isabel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps this wife is not altogether the treasure you think she is,&rdquo; the
      young woman answered, with the indirection of her sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seth found words entirely inadequate to express his dissent. He could only
      smile at her, as if the doubt were too preposterous to be even suggested,
      and walk up and down in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still intent upon her work, and with her head inclined so that he saw only
      a softened angle of face beneath the crown of glowing light-hued hair, she
      made answer, speaking more slowly than was usual with her, and with
      frequent pauses:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you know all my story, though it is a part of your family&rsquo;s
      history on both sides. You remember my father&mdash;a sporting,
      horse-racing man of the world, and you know that my mother died when I was
      a baby. You knew me here, one summer, as a visiting cousin, and we played
      and quarrelled as children do. Now you know me again as your brother&rsquo;s
      wife&mdash;but that is all. You know nothing of the rest&mdash;of how my
      father, proud about me as he was common in other things, kept me mewed up
      among governesses and housekeepers in one part of the house, while his
      flash companions rioted in another part; of how my wretched, chafing
      girlhood was spent among servants and tutors, with not so much as a
      glimpse of the world outside, like any Turkish girl; of how, when your
      brother, because he was a cousin, did become the one friend of my father&rsquo;s
      who might be invited into the drawing room, and be introduced to me, and
      took a fancy that he would like to marry me, I welcomed even such a chance
      for emancipation, and almost cried for joy; and of how I woke up afterward&mdash;no,
      this is what you do not know.&rdquo; There was a considerable pause here. &ldquo;And I
      do not know why I tell this to you now, except that I want you to
      understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>do</i> understand, Isabel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact he did not understand at all, but he thought he did,
      which, for present purposes, came to the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you can realize,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;how I feel at the thought of staying
      here the rest of my life&mdash;or, even if we go elsewhere&mdash;of having
      my life mapped out for me without any regard to my wishes and aspirations,
      while you are just pluming your wings for soaring, and can fly as high as
      you like with no one to gainsay you. Oh, what it must be to be a man!&rdquo; She
      was looking up at him now, with enthusiasm supplanting the repining in her
      eyes. &ldquo;And you love your work, so, too! You are so clever and capable! You
      can be anything you like in your profession&mdash;and it is impossible
      that I should ever be anything that I want to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A month ago, when he first came to the farm, this calm assumption of his
      ability to carve whatever part he desired out of the journalistic cake
      would have fallen upon Seth like cruel and calculated sarcasm. As it was,
      he winced a little under its exaggeration, but the substance pleased him.
      He squared his shoulders unconsciously as he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am only at the threshold as yet, but if there is any such thing
      as doing it, I am going to push my way on. It doesn&rsquo;t seem so easy always,
      when you are right in the thick of the fight, but now, after my rest here,
      I feel like an eagle refreshed. I am full of new ideas and ambitions. I
      owe a good deal of it to Ansdell, I suppose. You never saw such a fellow
      for making everybody believe as he does, and take an exalted view of
      things, and long to be doing something great. John prescribed him to me as
      a doctor would some medicine, and I took him more or less under protest,
      but I feel immensely better already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel took only a languid interest in the inspiring qualities of this
      prodigy, and reverted to her own grievance:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you will go and conquer your position. I will stay here and count
      those miserable poplars across the road&mdash;did you ever see a more
      monotonous row?&mdash;and work anti-macassars for no one to see, and mope
      my heart out. Why, do you know, I haven&rsquo;t one single correspondent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The full enormity of the situation thus revealed was lost upon Seth, who
      had never written more than half-a-dozen letters in his life, and did not
      see why people who did not have to write letters should want to do so. But
      he said &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; as compassionately as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not one. I did think you might have taken pity on me, but for all the
      year that you have been away, I have never heard a word from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wrote once or twice to Albert,&rdquo; Seth answered, tentatively, to occupy
      time until he could turn around in his mind the immense suggestion
      involved in this complaint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and I used to hear at the breakfast table&mdash;&lsquo;Oh, by the way,
      Aunt Sabrina, Seth sends his love to you and Isabel&mdash;&rsquo; only this and
      nothing more! What is the good of having a literary man in the family, if
      he doesn&rsquo;t write you long, nice letters?&rdquo; The vista which had flashed
      itself before Seth&rsquo;s mental vision was filled with dazzling light. He
      could not mask the exultation in his voice as he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really want me to write to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought not to have waited to be asked,&rdquo; she said, smiling again. &ldquo;Yes,
      you shall write me&mdash;and long letters too, mind&mdash;as often as you
      like.&rdquo; She added after a moment&rsquo;s pause, in which both had been turning
      over the same idea, &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be afraid of writing too often. The
      bundle from the post office always comes to me in the morning, hours
      before <i>he</i> gets downstairs. Dana brings it up when he comes back
      from the cheese-factory, and it never goes into any one&rsquo;s hands but mine.
      Beside, henceforth I shall watch for it all the more carefully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning Seth prepared once again to leave the homestead, but this
      time with a light heart and a gay demeanor. A month&rsquo;s absence had served
      so to remodel his views of the <i>Chronicle</i>, that he already felt
      himself to be a personage of importance, in its control. He had been
      constantly spoken of in the village as &ldquo;one of the editors&rdquo; of that
      journal, and found so much pleasure in the designation that he had come to
      use it in thinking of himself. He felt himself fired, too, with new
      enthusiasm and power by his talks with Ansdell, and he believed, not only
      that he saw where his past errors had lain, but that he knew now the trick
      of success. Above all, he was to write long letters to Isabel, and receive
      answers equally long and nice from her, and&mdash;this gave him an
      especial sense of delight&mdash;it was all to be a secret between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun shone brightly, too, after the rain, as if to be in harmony with
      his mood. Albert was more affable than he had been before, and after
      breakfast, and while the carriage was being brought around, gave him some
      cigars for the journey, and a $20 bill for pocket money. These were
      pleasant preludes to a little brotherly conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would hurry up and get to have a say on the <i>Chronicle</i>
      as soon as you can, Seth,&rdquo; said the lawyer, holding him by the lappel in
      fraternal fashion. &ldquo;You can help me there, help me very materially. I am
      going to be nominated for Congress in this district next year&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      whisper about it yet, but I&rsquo;ve got it solid. I haven&rsquo;t let any grass grow
      under my feet since I moved here, and they can&rsquo;t beat me in the
      Convention. But the <i>Chronicle</i> can do a good deal in the election,
      and I look to you for that. I am not going to Washington without knowing
      my business after I get there. There is a big thing on hand, big for me,
      big for you too. Good-bye now, my boy; I must get upstairs to my writing.
      You won&rsquo;t forget!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No, Seth promised, very cordially and heartily, he would not forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      When his traps had been piled again into the carriage, and he said
      good-bye to his Aunt and to Alvira, no Isabel was to be seen. She had been
      at breakfast, but had subsequently disappeared. Seth went into the living
      room&mdash;no one was there. He opened the door to the stairs and called
      out her name&mdash;no answer. As he closed the door again, he heard the
      faintest tinkle imaginable from a piano key. He had not thought of the
      parlor, which was ordinarily unused, but he hastened to it now. Isabel
      stood at the instrument, her head bowed; her finger still pressing the
      key. She turned with a dear little exclamation, which might be either of
      surprise or satisfied expectancy, and held out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you <i>wouldn&rsquo;t</i> go, after all, without saying good-bye to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Isabel, you know better!&rdquo; answered Seth, still very downright for
      his years. He was actually pained at her having fancied him capable of
      such a thing, and while he held her hand, he looked at her with mild
      reproach in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do I?&rdquo; she answered, rather inconsequently. Then she sighed, and
      bowed her fair head again. &ldquo;Have you given it a thought at all&mdash;how
      lonely it will be after you are gone for&mdash;for those who are left
      behind? I can&rsquo;t bear to think of it&mdash;I came in here because I
      couldn&rsquo;t stand and see the horses at the door, and the preparations for
      your going. It is as if the tomb door were swinging back on me again. I am
      foolish, I know&mdash;&rdquo; here the words were much hampered in their flow by
      incipient sobs&mdash;&ldquo;but if you could realize my position&mdash;the awful
      desolation of it, the&mdash;the&mdash;&rdquo; She broke down altogether, and,
      with the disengaged hand, put her handkerchief to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seth had never seen a young and beautiful woman in tears before, off the
      stage, but his racial instincts served him in the emergency. He gently
      took her hand down again, holding them both, now, in his. He told her,
      again surprising himself by the smoothness and felicity of his words, how
      delightful she had made his visit, how deeply he prized her sympathy and
      compassionated her lot, and how the pangs of regret at parting were only
      solaced by the thought that she had permitted him to write. Then he kissed
      her&mdash;and hurried out to the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The handsome, high-bitted grays made short work of the drive to Thessaly
      station, where John was waiting to have a parting word, so that Seth
      scarcely had time to collect his thoughts and settle accounts with
      himself, before the train started. Three hours later when he got off at
      Tecumseh, he had progressed no further in his work of striking a moral
      balance than:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all, she is my cousin as well as my sister-in-law.&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HAT man of
      achievement cannot recall some one short period of his life which seems to
      transcend in significance and value all the rest of his career&mdash;when
      great things for which he had only unconsciously waited came to him
      without the asking; when the high court of events rendered its sudden,
      unexpected verdict of success, without costs to him who had never made a
      plea; when the very stars in their courses seemed to have privily
      conspired to fight for him? How swift, inexplicable, even amazing it all
      was! And yet how simple too! And when the first flush of astonishment&mdash;half
      delight, half diffidence&mdash;had passed, how natural it all seemed; how
      mind and manners and methods all expanded to meet the new requirements;
      how calmly and as a matter of course the dignity was worn, the increment
      appropriated, the mental retina adapted to the widened focus! How easily,
      too, he sloughed off his own conviction that it was all pure luck, and
      accepted the world&rsquo;s kind judgment of deserved success! Who is it that
      accuses the world, and rails at its hardness of heart? What man among us
      all, in the hour of honest introspection, does not know that he is rated
      too high, that he is in debt to the credulity, the generosity, the dear
      old human tendency to hero-worship, of his fellows?
    </p>
    <p>
      This is an extract from a letter which the successful Seth Fairchild wrote
      a few months ago. Chronologically, it is dated only a couple of years
      after the occurrences with which we are now concerned&mdash;but to him an
      interval of decades doubtless seemed to separate the periods. Perhaps the
      modesty of it is a trifle self-conscious, and the rhetoric is of a
      flamboyant kind which he will never, apparently, outgrow, but at all
      events it shows a disposition to be fair as between himself and history.
      The period of great fortune, to which he alludes, is to be glanced at in
      this present chapter&mdash;to be limned, though only in outline, more
      clearly no doubt than he himself could be trusted to do it. For, though a
      man have never so fine a talent for self-analysis, you are safe to be
      swamped if you follow him a step beyond your own depth. In cold fact, Seth
      could no more tell how it was that, within one short year, he rose from
      the very humblest post to become Editor of the <i>Chronicle</i>, than
      Master Tom here can explain why he has outgrown his last summer&rsquo;s
      knickerbockers while his twin brother hasn&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been back at his work in Tecumseh only a month when word came to
      the office one morning that Mr. Tyler could not come&mdash;that he had
      been seriously injured in the havoc wrought by a runaway horse. It was too
      early for either editor or proprietor to be on the scene, and Arthur Dent
      at that hour was the visible head of the staff. He and Seth had scarcely
      spoken to each other for months&mdash;in fact since that disagreeable
      evening encounter&mdash;but he walked over now to our young man&rsquo;s desk and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fairchild, you would better take the News to-day. Tyler has been
      badly hurt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marvelling much at the favoritism of the selection, for Dent had not only
      passed Murtagh over but had waived his own claims of precedence, Seth,
      changed desks. He got through the work well enough, it appeared, but he
      mistrusted deeply his ability to hold the place. Mr. Samboye did not seem
      to approve his promotion, though he said nothing, and the manner in which
      Mr. Workman looked at him in his new chair seemed distinctly critical.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the paper had gone to press, and some little routine work against
      the next morning&rsquo;s start was out of the way, he wavered between idling the
      remaining two hours away among the exchanges, or attempting an editorial
      article for the morrow, such as Mr. Tyler occasionally contributed. His
      former experience with Mr. Samboye dismayed him a bit, but he concluded to
      try the editorial experiment again. Some things which Ansdell had said one
      day on the Silver question remained in his mind, and he made them the
      basis of a half-column article. He was finishing this when the office-boy
      told him Mr. Workman wished to see him below. He took his Silver article
      with him, vaguely hoping, hardly expecting, to be congratulated on his
      day&rsquo;s work, and told to keep the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seth&rsquo;s impressions of his employer were that he was a hard, peremptory
      man, and he searched his face now for some sign of softness in vain. Mr.
      Workman motioned him to a seat, and said abruptly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were on the News desk to-day. Did you take it yourself, or were you
      sent there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Dent told me to take it, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he take it himself, or put Murtagh on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth had it in mind to explain that Murtagh did not come down early
      enough, but he remembered how strenuous the rules were in the matter of
      matutinal punctuality, and concluded to say simply that he didn&rsquo;t know.
      Mr. Workman looked at him for a moment, made some arabesque figures with
      his pencil on the edge of the blotter, looked at him again, and then said,
      in a milder tone than Seth had supposed his voice capable of:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may as well be candid with you. I have been very much disappointed in
      you so far. You haven&rsquo;t panned out at all as your brother led me to expect
      you would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a knock-down blow. Poor Seth could only turn his copy about in
      his hands and stammer: &ldquo;I am very sorry. In what way have I failed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be hard to tell exactly in what way. I should say it was in a
      general failure to be the sort of young man I thought you were going to
      be. You have shown no inclination, for example, to write anything&mdash;and
      yet your brother praised you up to the skies as a writer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what was the good? I did write a long paragraph when I first came
      here, and handed it in to Mr. Samboye, and he tore it up before my eyes!
      That would be enough to discourage anybody!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he did that with you too, did he?&rdquo; Mr. Workman made more arabesques
      on his blotter, shading them with great neatness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seth thought this was a favorable opportunity to get in his Silver
      article, and handed it to the proprietor with a word of explanation. Mr.
      Workman read it over carefully and laid it aside without a syllable of
      comment. There was nothing in his face to show whether he liked it or not.
      He surrounded all his penciled figures with a wavy border, and said again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there are your associations. Before ever you came I was discouraged
      at the amount of money and time and health my young men were squandering
      in saloons. It had become a scandal to the town. I get a young man in from
      the country, whose habits are vouched for as perfect, with an idea that he
      will influence the rest, and lo and behold! he becomes the boss guzzler of
      the lot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a good deal of justice in that, Mr. Workman&mdash;or there was.
      But since I&rsquo;ve been back this time it has been changed. I have moved into
      another boarding house where I have a room to myself, and I have read at
      home almost every evening when I was not with Mr. Ansdell. I think I see
      the folly of that old way, as clearly as any one can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ansdell and I had a long talk about you the other day. It was he who gave
      me my first idea that there was anything in you. He is something of a
      crank on certain subjects, but he knows men like a book. I have been
      saying to myself that if he liked you there must be more in you than I had
      discovered. If I am right in this, now is your time to show it. It is a
      toss up, the doctors say this afternoon, whether poor Tyler lives or dies.
      In any case he won&rsquo;t be about in months. You can keep on at the desk for a
      while. We&rsquo;ll see how you make it go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next afternoon, when the inky boy brought up the damp first copies
      from the clanging, roaring region of the press, Seth was transfixed with
      bewilderment at seeing his article in the position of honor on the
      editorial page. While he still stared at it, amazed and troubled, Mr.
      Samboye with an angry snort swung around in his chair to face him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this Silver thing yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it is your conception of the ethics of journalism, is it, to sneak
      leaders into the composing, room without authority?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sneaked nothing in! I gave the copy to Mr. Workman last night. I am as
      much surprised to see it the leader as you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Samboye rose abruptly, and strode through the room to the stairs. They
      were ricketty at best and they trembled, the whole floor trembled, under
      his wrathful and ponderous tread.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fat-armed foreman, who was in on his eternal quest for copy, had heard
      this dialogue. He grinned as the Editor slammed the door below, and
      chuckled out &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get his comb cut now. The boss ordered your thing to
      be the leader himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Samboye presently returned with his broad face glowing crimson, and
      seated himself at his work again in gloomy silence. He made more erasures
      than usual, and soon gave it up altogether, taking his hat and stick with
      an impatient gesture, and stamping his way out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time went on. The luckless Mr. Tyler died, and Seth became confirmed in
      his place. He had developed more strongly, perhaps, than any other one
      trait, the capacity for system, and he was able to so remodel and expedite
      the routine work of the News desk that he had a good deal of time for
      editorial writing. His matter was never again given the place of honor,
      but it came to be and important and regular feature of the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      He worked hard on the paper&mdash;and almost equally hard, by spells, at
      home evenings. He did drop in at Bismarck&rsquo;s or some like place, for a few
      moments now and then, but he was careful to avoid games, or any further
      intimacy with habitués. Had it not been for Ansdell and Dent, this part of
      his new regimen would have been well nigh impossible, for the gregarious
      instinct was strong in him&mdash;as it is in any young man worth his salt&mdash;and
      associations of some sort were as necessary as food to him. He had
      discovered, long before this, that Dent was an old acquaintance of
      Ansdell&rsquo;s, and that he, in fact, had told the latter about Seth and his
      profitless courses, and interested the lawyer in his case.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had learned, too, that this pale &ldquo;Young Man Christian&rdquo; as Watts had
      called him derisively, had from the first been well-disposed toward him,
      and, when the emergency of Tyler&rsquo;s absence came up, had waived alike his
      own claims to preferment and his justifiable personal pique, and thrust
      Seth forward into the place because he felt that he needed some such
      incentive to make a man of himself. This was very high conduct, and Seth
      tried hard to like Dent a great deal in return. He never quite succeeded.
      They were too dissimilar in temperament to ever become close friends. Seth
      explained it to himself by saying that Dent was too cold and
      non-emotional. But Dent himself never seemed conscious of anything lacking
      in their relations, and they were certainly cordial and companionable
      enough when they met, generally two evenings a week, at Mr. Ansdell&rsquo;s
      chambers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing less like the bachelor&rsquo;s den dear to tradition can be imagined.
      There were no pipes, for the lawyer smoked cigars and nothing else; there
      was no litter of papers, opened books, pamphlets, scraps and the like, for
      he was the soul of order; no tumbled clothes, odd boots, overflowing
      trunks, etc., for he was the pink of neatness. He used to like to describe
      himself in the words with which Evelyn paints his father, as &ldquo;of a
      thriving, neat, silent, methodical genius,&rdquo; but it was always with a
      twinkling eye, for surely no man was ever less silent. He was a born
      talker&mdash;nervous, eager, fluent, with a delicate sense of the sound
      and shading of words, a keen appreciation of all picturesque and salient
      points, a rare delight in real humor, and, above all, with tremendous
      capabilities of earnestness. Conceive such a man, if you can&mdash;for
      there will never be another like him&mdash;and then endow him in your mind
      with a marvelous accumulation of knowledge, with convictions upon every
      conceivable subject, and with nothing short of a passion for enforcing
      these upon those of whom he was fond&mdash;and some idea of the perfect
      ascendancy he gained over Seth will have been obtained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ansdell was neither impeccable nor omniscient. There was much in both
      his theories and his practice which would not commend itself to the moral
      statutes of the age; he attempted no defense, being incredulous as to the
      right of criticism upon personal predilections. But he had a flaming
      wrath, a consuming, intolerant contempt, for men who were unable to
      distinguish between private tastes and public duty. On this subject of
      public duty he was so strenuous, so deeply earnest, that often there
      seemed but a microscopic line between his attitude and fanaticism. But
      this zeal had its magnificent uses. Often it swayed despite themselves the
      politicians of his party who had least in common with him, and who
      disliked him and vaunted their conventional superiority to him even while
      they were being swept along toward nobler purposes than their own small
      souls could ever have conceived, in the current of feeling which his
      devotion had created.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took complete possession of Seth&rsquo;s mind, and he worked wonders upon it.
      There is neither room here, nor power, to analyze these achievements. The
      young man, heretofore through circumstances slow and mechanical, revealed
      under the inspiration of this contact his true temperament. He became as
      receptive as a sensitized plate in the camera. He seemed to take in facts,
      theories, emotions, prejudices, beliefs, through the very pores of his
      skin. He found himself hating one line of public action, and all its
      votaries, vividly; he found himself thrilling with violent enthusiasm for
      another line, and its exponents&mdash;such an enthusiasm as exiled men
      tremble under when they hear the national air of their native land.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not always right. Very often indeed he did injustice, in his mind,
      and in the types as well, to really well-meaning men who after their
      lights were just as patriotic as he was. He condemned with undue ferocity
      where he could not unreservedly praise, and, like most men of
      three-and-twenty who sit on the tripod of judgment upon their fellow
      mortals, he made many mistakes. But his mental and moral advance, despite
      these limitations, was tremendously swift, and, in the main, substantial.
      No man ever made the world budge an inch ahead who had not well developed
      the capacity for indignation at weak and wrong things. This indignant
      faculty grew and swelled in Seth&rsquo;s nature like a strong vine, spreading
      upon the tree of his admiration for his ideals.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a fair income now&mdash;twenty dollars a week&mdash;and he lived
      very well, having a room in a good house, and taking his meals down town.
      This was a condition of life which had always commended itself to his
      imagination, and he revelled now in realising it. Of course he saved no
      money. Through Ansdell and others he had made the acquaintance of a number
      of Tecumseh men of position, and he had been asked a little to their
      houses, but he had not gone more than once. This single experience did not
      dismay or humiliate him; he flattered himself that he came out of it with
      credit. But it did not interest him; it was wofully difficult to talk to
      the women he met&mdash;to know what to say to them. It was the easier to
      come back from this one excursion to his old Bohemian bachelor notions,
      and justify them to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The correspondence with Isabel had not been altogether so attractive as he
      had anticipated. It had its extremely pleasant side, of course, but there
      were drawbacks. She wrote well, but then most of her writing was about
      herself, which grew wearisome after a time. It was difficult too, to find
      time to answer her letters always when the philandering mood was upon him,
      and in this matter he found himself curiously the creature of his moods.
      The routine of daily newspaper toil had rendered him largely independent
      of them in his ordinary work. He wrote about as well one day as another.
      But there were seasons when he could not write to Isabel at all. Then he
      would say to himself that the need of doing so was a nuisance, and in this
      frame of mind he would generally end by reproaching himself for even
      entertaining the idea of a mild flirtation with his brother&rsquo;s wife. Not
      that there was anything wrong in it, of course; he was quite clear on this
      point; but it was so useless, such a gratuitous outlay of time and talent!
    </p>
    <p>
      But then next day, perhaps, a good dinner, or a chance glimpse of fresh
      romance in the exchanges, or some affecting play at the theatre of an
      evening, would bring back all the glamour of her pretty, tender face, the
      magic of her eyes, the perfume of her tawny hair. And then he could write,
      and did write, often with a force of sweet rhetoric, a moving quality of
      caressing ardor, which it is difficult to distinguish from love making.
    </p>
    <p>
      To him these letters did not mean that at all; they were really abstract
      reflections of the sentimental side of his nature, which might have been
      evoked by almost any likable, intelligent woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to the wife on the farm they seemed deeply, deliciously, personal.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII.&mdash;BOLTING THE TICKET.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was the year of
      a great political revival&mdash;coming none too soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a part of the history of human progress that grand moral movements,
      once they have fulfilled their immediate purpose, swing backward to the
      establishment of some new abuse. The net gain is, no doubt, century by
      century, continuous. But to those who look for episodic interest rather
      than epochal meaning the march of the race must often seem crab like&mdash;as
      when a Henry VIII utilizes a reforming revolt to crush and plunder a vast
      system of benefaction, and create a hard-fisted, commercial plutocracy
      with one hand, while calling into existence with the other a permanent
      class of starving poor; or when a Bonaparte makes the waning impetus of a
      democratic uprising serve his imperial ambition, and converts the legions
      of the Republic into the guards of a Caesar.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, in our own time, in our own country, craft and greed had climbed to
      the control of a great organization, baptized in the name of Freedom and
      excited still with the thoughts of its tremendous achievements, and
      diverted its forces to the service of base ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      This ignoble mastery had not gone unchallenged. More than one revolt
      against it had given promise, for a little, of success. But each in its
      failure had but repeated the familiar experience of yeomanry against
      trained troops, of sporadic, scattering popular impulses against the cool,
      consecutive plans of organized power. But it is the fate of despotisms,
      whether of a man or of a machine, to by excesses sap their own
      foundations. There came a time when the political usurpers who, through
      the listlessness of some citizens, the ancient prejudices of others, the
      mean lust for profit and place of still a third class, had attained power,
      went just a step too far.
    </p>
    <p>
      As this is a romance, and not a political history, it is permitted to
      avoid both dates and any details which might seem to fix a particular
      occurrence, and ask the reader to conceive that the crisis grew out of the
      manner in which these politicians obtained control of an imaginary but
      important Convention&mdash;that they bribed delegates, that they forged
      telegrams to secure a majority for themselves on the organizing committee,
      and that they made drunk the poor tool they had selected for Chairman and
      locked him in his hotel room that he might not escape them. It strains
      credulity to assume all this, I know, but its acceptance is essential to
      the story. Fortunately it is less difficult to credit the corollary&mdash;that
      the decent people of the State, led by an honest press, rose <i>en masse</i>
      and pulverized this machine at the following election.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at the outset of this crisis that Seth became Editor of the
      Tecumseh <i>Chronicle</i>. The young man had been, it need scarcely be
      said, deeply interested in the events which led up to it, and when the
      first of the party papers came out frankly, the morning after the
      Convention, refusing to support its nominations, he was in a tremor of
      delight. He scarcely dared hope that the <i>Chronicle</i> would follow
      their lead, but still he did hope. Mr. Samboye remained downstairs in
      consultation with Mr. Workman longer than usual on that eventful forenoon.
      They were settling the policy of the paper, of course, and the young news
      editor, perfunctorily weeding out copy for the &ldquo;first side,&rdquo; was conscious
      all the while of being eagerly anxious to know what this policy was to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Samboye presently came up, took his seat without the ordinary prelude
      of conversation, and began writing. He finished his article, still without
      a word to any one, and took it down to Mr. Workman. He was absent but a
      few moments. On his return Seth asked him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do we bolt the ticket?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before he could answer, a telegraph boy came running up the stairs (this
      one actually did run) with a dispatch for Mr. Samboye. The editor opened
      and read it in a puzzled way at first, then more carefully and with a
      light of comprehension on his broad face. He folded the telegram up
      carefully, put it into his inner vest pocket and said to Seth:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we occupy a picturesque position on the top rail of the fence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The editor did not seem quite himself that day. He stayed about the
      editorial room instead of going out to lunch, until the leader proof was
      ready, and then he asked to read it himself, instead of letting it go in
      the ordinary course to the proof-reader. He made a good many corrections
      on it, which was unusual for him. Finally, about half-an-hour before the
      paper went to press, he took his departure, saying briefly to Seth that he
      would not return that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hours later the office boy summoned Seth to the counting-room below.
      Mr. Workman sat alone at his desk, with the day&rsquo;s <i>Chronicle</i> spread
      out before him, and with the original proof-sheet of the leader in his
      hand. He motioned Seth to close the doors, and to take a seat close beside
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have read this leader?&rdquo; he asked, after a moment&rsquo;s silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t like to say all that I think of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither should I,&rdquo; replied Mr. Workman with an iron-clad smile. He was
      very pale, and Seth scented a storm in the manner in which the grim smile
      faded from his face after an instant of hovering, as a gleam of wintry
      sunshine passes off the snow. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a story&mdash;a very curious story&mdash;back
      of this leader. I only know part of it; perhaps you can help me to get at
      the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not knowing what to say, Seth remained silent. The proprietor continued:
      &ldquo;When this leader left my hands this morning, it bolted the ticket, out
      and out. There was no mistake about it. It was squarefooted. As it is now,
      it&rsquo;s neither fish, flesh nor fowl. It condemns the Convention and the
      frauds, but it practically says that the result must be accepted. The
      worst of it is I didn&rsquo;t see the paper until the edition had been worked
      off. The alterations in the proof here, which make all the difference
      between white and black, are in Samboye&rsquo;s hand. Did he say anything to you
      about it? Was anybody up in the editorial room to see him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one came up to see him; he said nothing to me except that we were on
      the fence. That disgusted me so much that I asked nothing further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he say that when he came up from here&mdash;or later, after he had
      gone over the proof?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said it when&mdash;or no, hold on&mdash;he received a dispatch just
      before;&rdquo; and Seth recounted the episode of the telegram.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Workman was much impressed with this. He covered his blotter thick
      with scrolls and geometrical figures while he pondered it. At last he
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know where the telegram came from?&mdash;no, of course not. I
      think I know about where, and I think I can guess about what it said. It
      said that, in this matter of bolting tickets, one day&rsquo;s delay might make
      an immense amount of difference, and that it would be worth his while to
      keep the <i>Chronicle</i> non-committal in its first issue by hook or by
      crook. Take my word for it, that is what it said in substance. The fellows
      who sent it were scared about the <i>Chronicle</i>. They knew what an
      effect its course would have on the weeklies, most of which go to press
      to-morrow. They couldn&rsquo;t spend money better than in having us accept the
      ticket, and not only commit ourselves but the country editors&mdash;and <i>they&rsquo;ve
      bought Samboye!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence. The two men looked at each other. Finally
      Workman said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The worst feature of it is, there is no way of getting at the thing&mdash;of
      proving it. I suppose I could get an order compelling the Company to
      produce the telegram, but I am not sure, and then it would be a big
      scandal and a big expense.&rdquo; He lapsed into pencil work again and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is Samboye that kind of man?&rdquo; asked Seth. &ldquo;Oh yes, I have no
      illusions on that score. I very nearly caught him in a thing of this sort&mdash;on
      a smaller scale, of course&mdash;three years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why have I kept him? You were going to ask. Well, he is a good man in his
      way. He is an immensely clever writer, if you don&rsquo;t care much for solid
      argument, and do care for decorative stuff, with a good deal of fun, and
      epigram, and big words. People used to talk about his articles. I suppose
      hundreds of people buy the <i>Chronicle</i> just to read them. Well, we
      will have to lose those people, and all the others who will quarrel with
      us for bolting the ticket. For she&rsquo;s going to be bolted! So you better go
      to bed early to-night, and eat raw meat for breakfast, for we want a
      leader to-morrow that will make their hair curl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Seth in a flutter of strange excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you will have to take hold. Samboye shall never show his face in
      that room again. That&rsquo;s settled! I may get somebody else, later&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
      see. But you can carry it along for a time, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try&mdash;but I am afraid&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be afraid. In a campaign you simply want straightforward,
      red-hot, to-the-point writing. It is the rest of the year, when one must
      write general matter, that pulls on a man. Besides, Ansdell will help you
      out, if you need him. Oh, yes, and that reminds me&mdash;your brother
      Albert didn&rsquo;t show to very good advantage in that Convention. He might
      easily have made a better beginning in politics than that. From all
      accounts he had the Dearborn County delegates in his pocket, and, although
      these other scandals have diverted attention from it, I think the way they
      ratted over was about the worst thing in the whole affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t nice, for a fact,&rdquo; said Seth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had it mentioned in the paper, mostly on your account. But I am
      not so clear about keeping silent next week, when the Congressional
      Convention comes up. Your brother, I suppose, has Dearborn County solid
      for his own candidacy. But here in Adams County the delegates are for
      Ansdell&mdash;and of course he is our sort of man. I don&rsquo;t think much of a
      party paper interfering before the nomination is made, but this may be a
      case where it will be necessary&mdash;especially if Abe Beekman, up in Jay
      County, tries any of his funny work. However, it will be time enough to
      cross that bridge when we get to it. Meanwhile, say not a word to anybody,
      in the office or out of it, about what has happened. Just go ahead with
      the work, and pay attention to no one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no scandal. Mr. Samboye took his punishment quietly, and left
      Tecumseh shortly afterward, ostensibly on a long vacation. There was some
      little gossip, but no whisper of the actual facts in the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seth surprised himself by the excellence and evenness of his work in the
      new position. Probably he will never do better or stronger writing than he
      did in this his first campaign. For one thing, it is doubtful if any
      political contest can ever again appeal to his enthusiasm, and stir all
      his emotions to the glowing point of ardency, as this one did. In one
      sense his new position was embarrassing, for a number of the old time
      readers of the <i>Chronicle</i> refused to support it now against their
      party, and some of them said very disagreeable things about the youngster
      rattling about in Samboye&rsquo;s shoes. But there was another class, a larger
      class it seemed to him, who shared his enthusiasm, and, in their excited
      admiration for the course of the paper, heaped praises upon him even
      beyond his deserts. So he worked on, writing almost the entire page daily,
      coming down early in the morning and staying long after the paper was out,
      and giving scarcely a thought to the outside world.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had barely seen Ansdell since his promotion. He felt an even greater
      sense of loss in this than he would have done under ordinary
      circumstances, for the tremendous mental outpouring to which he was daily
      subjected made him almost famished, at times, for food in the form of
      conversation with this man who, of all others, most sympathized with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was a difficulty in the way&mdash;of which Seth&rsquo;s sensitiveness
      made, no doubt, a great deal too much. The fight for the Congressional
      nomination in the district was attracting attention all over the State,
      and, as evil luck would have it, Seth&rsquo;s brother was pitted against Seth&rsquo;s
      dearest friend. It was no ordinary contest, in which a man could with ease
      maintain a friendly neutrality. Everywhere the struggle in the
      Thirty-sixth District was regarded as a sample conflict, as embodying in
      itself all the features of the larger issue between the machine and the
      people. Albert Fairchild had identified himself so thoroughly with the
      party organization, and had played so prominent a part in the scandals
      which provoked the revolt, that his cause was distinctly that of the
      politicians; while Ansdell was just as distinctively the representative of
      the independent and rebellious element. In no other district of the State
      were the lines so clearly drawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a fortnight or so after Seth&rsquo;s assumption of the editorship that
      the District Convention was held&mdash;at the little village of Tyre, some
      dozen miles from Thessaly, up in Jay County. The <i>Chronicle</i> had
      taken no part in the contest. No one doubted that its sympathies were with
      Ansdell, but still it had not said so. The night before the Convention Mr.
      Workman advised Seth to write to his brother, warning him that if he were
      nominated the <i>Chronicle</i> could not support him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So long as we are in the bolting business, we might as well be hanged for
      a sheep as a lamb,&rdquo; said the proprietor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not a pleasant task, but Seth performed it as graciously as he
      could.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no news from Tyre next day save that Mr. Beekman of Jay was also
      a candidate, and that the Convention was in a deadlock. The second day,
      along with the news announcement that the Convention, after seventy-odd
      fruitless ballots, had adjourned for a week, came a despatch from Albert
      begging Seth to visit the farm for a couple of days, and talk the thing
      over, before the <i>Chronicle</i> took action. Upon consultation with Mr.
      Workman Seth replied that this was impossible, owing to the necessities of
      his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there came a letter from Albert, brief, but very much to the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>DEAR Brother: I am sorry if your work must suffer by your coming to
      me, but I think I have a claim upon you superior to even that of the </i>Chronicle<i>.
      If I have not, I ought to have. I decline to believe that, if you
      represent the matter to him as really imperative, my former friend, Mr.
      Workman, will place any obstacles in your way. But if he does I still
      insist that your choice between him and me must be a final one. I do not
      write a word to you about gratitude. I simply say, be here at the farm on
      Sunday&mdash;or never again.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Albert</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this there was nothing to do but for Seth to telegraph that he would
      come.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX.&mdash;THE WELCOME.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen Seth walked
      over from the Thessaly station, Sunday forenoon, to the farm, he was not,
      it may be imagined, in a placid frame of mind. There lay before him an
      interview with his brother which could not, in the nature of things, be
      pleasant, and which might very easily be distinctly unpleasant. It was his
      duty to say sundry things to Albert which were not in themselves nice, and
      if Albert was still in the mood shown forth by his peremptory letter,
      these remarks would very likely produce a scene. Seth was in no sense
      afraid of his brother, nor had the thrifty thought that this brother was a
      rich, childless man, to offend whom would be a gratuitous economic
      blunder, ever entered his head. The youngster had no faculty whatever for
      financial prudence. But he was grateful&mdash;almost ridiculously grateful&mdash;by
      nature. The trait is not a rare one, even in these days when a new
      civilization has substituted for individual patronage and beneficence the
      thanks-to-nobody trade-unionism of universal conceit and rivalry, but it
      was abnormally developed in the youngest of the Fairchilds.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said to himself, as he crossed the fields toward the white and red
      land-mark of house and barns on the side hill, that he owed everything in
      the world to this brother. Whatever there might be in his public attitude
      to condemn, however pernicious his politics might be, still it was his
      fraternal feeling and generosity which had created the vast gulf between
      Seth the plow-yokel and Seth the editor. These reflections brought no
      comfort to the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some perverse agency whispered to him, as he strode along over the
      stubble, that after all he had never really liked Albert; and this
      liberality of his, too, might it not be a mere cheap mess of pottage,
      thrown to Seth to console him for the loss of his rights in the farm? John
      had always been incredulous as to Albert&rsquo;s true goodness in this matter;
      might there not be something in these suspicions? Seth tried manfully to
      combat these ungenerous doubts, but they forced themselves upon his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was Albert&rsquo;s treatment of his wife! Seth had never been clear
      as to the exact nature of Isabel&rsquo;s grievance against her husband. No
      specific allegation of cruelty or neglect, much less of infidelity, had
      ever been laid by her at Albert&rsquo;s door in his brother&rsquo;s hearing. Indeed,
      so far as Seth&rsquo;s observation went, Albert had always appeared to be a
      decent enough sort of husband, complaisant even if somewhat indifferent,
      and acquiescent to the verge of weakness, in her whims. He seemed to
      refuse her nothing, in the matter of having her own way, and if he most
      often broke the ruling conjugal dumbness by satirical comments on her
      actions and opinions, he at least never seriously attempted to fetter
      either. This sounded like the description of a tolerable husband, as
      husbands go. But up against it was to be set Isabel&rsquo;s plaintive, pitiful,
      persistent assertion of unhappiness with him. And clearly she ought to
      know what her husband was like a good deal better than an outsider could.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the arguments did battle in Seth&rsquo;s mind, as he climbed the last fence,
      and felt his feet on ancestral soil. He had now only to cross a short
      stretch of pasture land to be at his journey&rsquo;s end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perfect silence rested on the farm. The fat cows lay lazily about him,
      comfortably chewing the cud of sweet aftermath; the cluster of bright,
      neat buildings fell into picturesque lines of composition before him, in
      the soft, hazy sunshine of Indian summer. The background of scarlet and
      ochre and deep purple-browns in the woods beyond, of warm mauve hills and
      pale, fluffy clouds above; the shaggy old horse, standing in tranquil
      bliss, with his head over the fence; the aged shepherd-dog stretched
      asleep on the kitchen door-stone in the sunny distance&mdash;all brought
      to him a sense of content and beauty which warmed his heart and calmed his
      thoughts. The spell of the peaceful, restful scene soothed him. Then, as
      by magic, the whole picture seemed to take on the charm of Isabel&rsquo;s
      presence. &ldquo;I am to see her!&rdquo; he said aloud, almost exultantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been no special pleasure in this prospect, a few hours before.
      Indeed, it had been months since he had been conscious of a genuine desire
      to meet his sister-in-law. At times of late it had even seemed to him that
      a meeting would be a source of embarrassment, just as the necessity of
      keeping up the clandestine correspondence presented itself often to him in
      the light of a bore.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now&mdash;yes! she was walking forth swiftly to meet him&mdash;coming
      over the grass with a gliding haste which had a wealth of welcome in every
      motion. The very genius of the mellow, warm-hearted season she seemed to
      his eyes as she advanced, clad in some soft, indefinite stuff,
      loose-flowing, and that in tint under the red noon sun could be the shadow
      on golden grain, or the light on dark puce grapes, or the dim, violet haze
      over the distant valley. She was near him now, beaming with unaffected
      delight, reaching out her hands in greeting&mdash;and his heart went to
      meet her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Seth! How good of you to come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had almost thrown herself into his arms, and had stood upon tiptoe to
      be kissed. He held himself back from the embrace, but he did kiss her, and
      he swung her hands now in his, looking into her glowing eyes with tender,
      responsive intentness, and smiling his joy. This reception did make him
      very happy, but he had also a great uneasiness lest some of the folks
      should be observing them from the windows of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      She divined his thoughts, and said, gayly: &ldquo;They are all at church!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Albert too?&rdquo; Seth knew that his brother was not of a religious
      turn; but he swiftly bethought himself, and added &ldquo;Oh, I forgot that
      election is coming on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she chirruped, springing along by his side, her arm tight in his,
      her walk reflecting exultantly her emotion, &ldquo;he is in New York. He will be
      back to-morrow. He has telegraphed me to have you wait.&rdquo; She dropped into
      a mock-serious tone: &ldquo;That is, of course, if you would <i>like</i> to
      wait?&rdquo; She looked up archly: &ldquo;Do you much mind waiting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I <i>mind!</i>&rdquo; He could only look his delight. His voice trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made a tiny skip, and lifted her face to him again, radiant with
      happiness. &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I could run and jump like any little
      child, I am so wild with joy! It seems such an age since we were together
      last! Only letters&mdash;but they were very nice, though. You dear boy,
      who taught you to write such pretty letters&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pressed her arm closer in his. &ldquo;Who taught me everything that is
      sweet?&rdquo; he whispered. It was all very delicious, but still it troubled
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They entered the house, and he excused himself while he took his hand-bag
      up to his old room, and made his toilet after the long hot walk. As he
      occupied himself thus, and brushed his novel beard, his thoughts were much
      perturbed. It was very far from his ideas to make love to his brother&rsquo;s
      wife. This bald statement of the situation which framed itself now in his
      mind, almost for the first time, repelled and alarmed him. Yet it seemed
      to sum up the state of affairs fairly. If there was not lovemaking in
      every feature of that meeting out on the lawn, then his conceptions of the
      tender passion were all at fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, it mustn&rsquo;t come to that!&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;A fellow ought to
      be able to be fond of his sister-in-law, and be pleasant to her, and
      sympathize with her and all that, without going beyond the bounds, and
      making a scoundrel of himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And it was with a deep resolution to be careful, and watch all his words,
      that he descended the stairs. He had taken out of his valise two front
      pages of a Sunday newspaper, containing &ldquo;Jeff Brigg&rsquo;s Love Story,&rdquo; which
      he had saved a while before for Isabel, and he gave them now to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is something I cut out for you, Isabel; it is a very pretty story,
      and I know you will like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how sweet of you! How well you know just what will please me most of
      all! And you shall read it to me! The other stories you have sent me were
      only moderately nice, because I had to read them by myself, but this&mdash;oh!
      this will be enchanting!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She arranged an easy chair&mdash;a low, capacious chair with light blue
      the dominant color in its covering&mdash;close beside the window in the
      parlor which overlooked the poplars, and seated herself in it. Seth
      brought a hassock for her feet, and then put his own chair along side,
      where he could see her, and still get a good light on the print. It was
      not easy for him to begin the reading, so great was the fascination of
      looking at his companion. The sunlight flared upon the white curtains
      above her, and its reflections glowed back again from her crown of golden
      braids, luminous against the azure of the chair, and tipped with soft
      radiance her rounded profile, in cameo-relief against the deep olive of
      the poplars. Isabel was an artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a beginning at last, and read until the democrat-wagon drove up in
      the yard, with its load of church-goers. She made a little mouth at the
      interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose Sabrina will come in now, and dinner will be ready soon. But
      afterwards we can be quiet again, for she always reads the Bible in her
      own room Sunday afternoons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All through the cold dinner, despite the necessity of answering Aunt
      Sabrina&rsquo;s and Milton&rsquo;s remarks, Seth found his mental vision fixed on that
      beautiful profile against the leafy background; especially sweet was the
      portrait when the eyes were closed, and the lovely fullness above the
      lids, as in the face of a Madonna, was revealed in the wavering light.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story was not to be finished that afternoon, for Elhanan Pratt and his
      daughter dropped in almost before the meal was finished, and a little
      later Annie Fairchild came. There was not even much consolation in the
      pretty grimaces expressive of discontent which Isabel from time to time,
      when the visitors were not looking, confided to Seth. It was a very dull
      afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The venerable Mr. Pratt, a weazen, verbose little &ldquo;gentleman-farmer,&rdquo; who
      wore a huge black satin stock over his high flaring collar opening behind,
      and remained clean-shaven, in pious memory of Henry Clay and the coon
      campaign, sat on the edge of his chair and droned commonplaces by the
      hour. He evidently had an axe to grind by his visit, and he was much
      disappointed by Albert&rsquo;s absence. But if he could not see &ldquo;the coming
      Congressman,&rdquo; as he called him once or twice, and sound that new political
      magnate as to his own renomination for the Assembly, he could at least
      enjoy the monopoly of a long conversation with the Editor of the Tecumseh
      <i>Chronicle</i>, and impress that young man with the breadth and value of
      his views. So Seth was forced to spend three dreary hours, answering as
      briefly as might be, listening wearily, and stealing stray glances at the
      three young women, who made a brighter group on the other side of the
      parlor stove. Once or twice he tried tentatively to engraft himself upon
      their conversation, and choke old Elhanan off, but the solemn little bore
      relentlessly brought him back to the dry bones of politics. Thus it
      happened that he had barely had an opportunity of exchanging a word with
      his cousin Annie, when she stood up and said, &ldquo;I must be going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked over to her now, and put his hand in a brotherly way on her
      shoulder, as he helped her on with her cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve scarcely had a word with you, Annie,&rdquo; he said, smiling. &ldquo;How is your
      grandmother? I needn&rsquo;t ask how <i>you</i> are. You grow prettier everyday.
      And how do you get on with your school?&rdquo;&mdash;for the girl was now
      teaching in the district school house over the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered, &ldquo;Oh, grandmother is about the same; perhaps a little weaker,
      but as bright mentally as ever. You are looking well, Seth, and quite the
      man now. Your beard becomes you&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t it, Isabel? We are so sorry
      you can&rsquo;t come to-morrow night. We see so little of you since you have
      become a city man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry that I can&rsquo;t come!&rdquo; repeated Seth after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come where?&rdquo; Isabel interposed with a ready explanation. &ldquo;There is to be
      a husking over at Crump&rsquo;s to-morrow evening&mdash;the first of the season.
      There will be a big party of young people, and Crump sent over by Annie an
      invitation for us. But I have explained that you are here on business,
      which may very likely occupy you to-morrow evening, and that in any case
      you would have to write your leaders for the next day&rsquo;s paper. We are ever
      so sorry, Annie,&rdquo; she added, turning to the school-teacher now, &ldquo;but you
      know this is a terribly busy time with Seth, and we mustn&rsquo;t think of
      letting our little country sociables interfere with his work. Some time,
      soon, he will come for a real vacation, instead of a flying business trip,
      and then we can monopolize him&mdash;and we will, too, won&rsquo;t we, Annie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annie smiled, a little faintly, as if her heart were not altogether in it,
      and replied, &ldquo;Yes, to be sure we will.&rdquo; She added, to Seth, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say
      goodbye. I suppose I shall see you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He assented, and went to the door with her, and stood on the steps
      watching her as she walked away in the autumn dusk. Decidedly she <i>was</i>
      a pretty girl!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pratts, father and daughter, consented upon the shadowiest suggestion
      of an invitation to stay and partake of the picked-up Sunday tea, and that
      involved their spending the evening. Aunt Sabrina came in, and the talk
      was dreary and general. So &ldquo;Jeff Briggs&rdquo; and his amatory affairs went over
      to the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning Seth walked over to Thessaly and saw John. The interview
      depressed him. John had had some idea of following the <i>Chronicle&rsquo;s</i>
      lead, and bolting the State ticket, but the county politicians had bullied
      him out of the thing by threatening the destruction of the job-printing
      business connected with the <i>Banner of Liberty</i>, and the boycotting
      of the paper itself. All his inclinations, too, were toward Ansdell in the
      Congressional race; but Albert had loaned him some money, and, beside, he
      couldn&rsquo;t see his way clear to disregarding, openly at least, the fraternal
      tie. He was consequently in a savage mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking of taking out the head-line of the paper this week,&rdquo; he
      growled, with a sardonic humor, &ldquo;and putting in instead a cut of a runaway
      slave, with a bundle over his shoulder, which is in the job-room here,
      left over from the days when there was slavery in New York State, and
      masters used to advertise in the old paper for fugitives. &lsquo;<i>Banner of
      Liberty</i> &rsquo; indeed! By heaven, it ought to be &lsquo;<i>Banner of
      Bondage!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no comfort or profit in discussing the situation, either general
      or local, with John. He neither knew nor cared, he swore, what Albert&rsquo;s
      chances were to dissolve the deadlock on the morrow. He might or he
      mightn&rsquo;t; it was all one to him, and apparently to the party, who were the&mdash;&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      Seth left John to his bad temper and language, and returned to the farm in
      the afternoon. A telegram from Albert awaited him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;New York, Oct. 19.&mdash;If possible conclude business, home to-night,
      at latest to-morrow morning. Wait for me at all hazards.&mdash;Albert.&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      To provide against a possible delay over Tuesday, Seth devoted the
      afternoon, and the earlier part of the evening, to writing matter for his
      paper, which Dana was to convey to Thessaly for the early morning train,
      when he went to the cheese-factory. If Albert was coming at all that
      night, he would arrive about eight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nine o&rsquo;clock came. Aunt Sabrina, after sitting in stem silence by the
      living-room stove for an hour or two, looking at the wall-paper as her
      brother Lemuel had been won&rsquo;t to do, went up to bed with a frigid &ldquo;good
      night.&rdquo; The farm people had all retired with the chickens, long before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely raising his eyes from his writing, Seth remarked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How Aunt Sabrina has failed since I left the farm! She grows ever so much
      like father. Poor old woman, she was so eager to have Albert come here, so
      elated with the idea that the family was to be restored to social and
      political dignity again&mdash;and now the apples seem to be all dead-sea
      fruit to her. I can&rsquo;t see that she takes the slightest interest in
      Albert&rsquo;s campaign. Odd, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel was sitting near the stove, around the corner of the table from
      him. The reddish radiance reflected down from the shaded lamp fell upon
      her rounded chin and her smooth white neck, dainty in tint as the ruffle
      in which it lost itself. Above this lace at the back, as she bent over her
      embroidery, some stray curling wisps of hair gleamed like gold in the
      light. She replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that at all. She&rsquo;s interested enough in the Congress idea, or
      would be if she hadn&rsquo;t something else on her mind. The prying old piece
      found out, by quizzing Dana, about our writing to each other. She has got
      it into her ridiculous old head, I feel sure, that there is something
      between us. Didn&rsquo;t you notice the way she eyed us at the dinner table
      yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth did not answer. His article was unfinished, but he suddenly found
      himself in doubt whether it was not already long enough. He reflected, or
      tried to reflect, for a moment, while the soft tones of her voice murmured
      in his ears, then added a sentence which might serve as a conclusion, and
      scrawled a dash underneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! I&rsquo;m through!&rdquo; he said, and looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were fixed upon his face. They were in the shadow of the tinted
      lamp-shade, but they had a light of their own&mdash;a languorous, alluring
      glow. He had never looked into such eyes before; they fascinated him, and
      he knew, in a delicious trembling, that his own were answering them in
      kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can read to me now,&rdquo; she said, the rapt, wistful gaze melting into a
      smile. &ldquo;He will not come to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth took the story, as she gave it to him from her workbox, and glanced
      over it to pick up the thread of the narrative where it had been dropped.
      As he was still thus engaged, he felt her hand laid upon his, and, as
      their eyes met again, heard her low, soft voice murmur:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know why I declined our invitation for the husking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence, which the young man felt that his face made full of
      acquiescent meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered her own question: &ldquo;I wanted you here, all for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth lost himself in an uplifting, floating sensation of ethereal
      beatitude. Her hand was in his now, warm and palpitating, and he raised it
      to his lips. It was difficult to breathe, but the oppression in his breast
      was all delight. He rose to his feet, his arms outstretched, his heart
      beating in exultant tumult. He heard her whisper&mdash;he could scarcely
      see her for the magnetic waving before his eyes&mdash;the refrain of the
      story: &ldquo;So strong and yet so gentle!&rdquo; His lips were formed for the
      passionate utterance&mdash;already framed in his heart&mdash;&ldquo;My darling!&rdquo;
       when there came the sound of footsteps on the path without, and of a hand
      upon the latch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seth mechanically took up the manuscript of his article, and turned toward
      the door. Beneath an impassive mien, far more composed than he dared to
      hope, there was the sensation of being hurled down, down, through the air,
      to unwelcome earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Albert. He looked at the two cursorily but closely, and only said,
      as he tossed his bag into a chair:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Train was late. You go to bed at once, Isabel. I have particular business
      with Seth.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XX.&mdash;THE NIGHT: THE BROTHERS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>lbert seemed in an
      amiable mood as, divesting himself of his outer garments, he drew up a
      chair by the fire, offered Seth a cigar from his case and lighted one
      himself. He examined Seth&rsquo;s face by the flame of the match, as the latter
      lighted his cigar, and appeared to be satisfied with the inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down here,&rdquo; he said pleasantly. &ldquo;I want a good long talk with you. It
      was too bad to keep you waiting so long, but there was no help for it. I
      couldn&rsquo;t see the people in New York that I wanted to see until to-day, and
      it was only by good fortune that I caught the train as it was. Then we
      were delayed on the road, of course. If an engineer on this one-horse line
      should ever get a train through on time I believe he&rsquo;d have a fit, just
      from the shock of the thing. And then I had to wake up the man at the
      livery stable in Thessaly&mdash;fancy his being asleep at eight o&rsquo;clock!&mdash;and
      he would only bring me as far as the foot of the hill, because he had been
      up to a dance all the previous night. But of course, in my position now,
      running for office, I couldn&rsquo;t complain. Beside, I ought to be used to all
      these little delights of rural existence by this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert stretched his feet out comfortably on the rail of the stove, and
      leaned back in his chair with an air of enjoyment. He had been growing
      very stout this past year, Seth noticed, and the bald spot on his crown
      had visibly spread. He seemed unwontedly good-natured too&mdash;a natural
      and proper accompaniment to increasing obesity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But all this has nothing to do with my asking you to come here, has it?
      Did Workman raise any objections to your coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course not, after he read your letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer smiled complacently: &ldquo;I thought that letter would fetch him. Of
      course, my boy, the harshness of the letter was for effect on him, not on
      you. It simply gave you a chance to say you had <i>got</i> to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth did not find himself wholly clear on this point, but he nodded
      assent. Albert looked at him, and seemed a trifle annoyed at having the
      conversation all to himself, but he went on after a moment&rsquo;s pause,
      speaking now with good humored gravity:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First of all, I ought to tell you how proud I have been of your fine
      progress on the <i>Chronicle</i>. I doubt if there is another young man of
      your age in the State who has done so much climbing in so short a time. I
      take a real satisfaction in thinking that you are my brother. I can&rsquo;t tell
      you how often I say to myself: &lsquo;Albert Fairchild, the best thing you ever
      did in your life, or ever will do, was to give that boy a chance.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was gall and wormwood to the young man. He had almost succeeded in
      regaining the composure so abruptly scattered by Albert&rsquo;s unexpected
      arrival. The fluttering agitation came back now, and brought with it a
      painful sense of shame and self-reproach as Albert&rsquo;s words recalled the
      scene which his entrance had interrupted. Seth did not look his brother in
      the face, but murmured some commonplace of gratitude. He was glad that
      there was a red shade on the lamp; it might conceal his flush of
      humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert went on: &ldquo;But you were not invited here so peremptorily just to
      hear this. Brotherly pride and affection are things that don&rsquo;t need words&mdash;that
      can be taken for granted&mdash;are they not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth tried to smile, and said, &ldquo;Yes, of course they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, youngster, I am taking them for granted in your case. Mind, as I
      said in my letter, I am not saying a word about gratitude. I don&rsquo;t want
      the thing to be put on that footing at all. Brothers ought to be able to
      help each other, and all that, without lugging in the question of
      gratitude. I am talking to you as one man should to another who bears the
      same name, and was of the same mother. By George! poetry, isn&rsquo;t it? Well,
      the point is this. The time has come when you can help me, help me
      immensely. I am not in this fight for myself alone. Personally I care very
      little about going to Congress. But I have got the family to consider, and
      I am in a position now where I can make a ten-strike for it. A good deal
      of it I have created myself. These countrymen up here in Dearborn County
      fancy they are shrewd politicians, but it has taken me, almost a novice in
      politics, less than two years to get the whole machinery right under my
      thumb. It&rsquo;s in the blood, I tell you! There wasn&rsquo;t another manager in this
      whole section that could hold a candle to the old Senator, in his day,&mdash;and
      if he could keep track of things now I imagine he&rsquo;d admit that his
      grandson was no slouch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert chuckled quietly at the slang word, the expressiveness of which
      pleased him, and at the vision of the satisfaction of the departed
      ancestor which it suggested. He proceeded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you all my plans, but I am in a big combination. I have made
      use of my large connections as a lawyer in New York to arrange some things
      which would open your eyes if you knew them. It is all settled that I am
      going on to a Committee which will be worth while, I can tell you. And
      then, once started in the thing, with my grandfather&rsquo;s name back of me,
      there is no telling where I may not climb. A name that has figured in the
      blue book as ours has is a tremendous power. The Republic derides
      heredity, but the public believes in it. It is human nature, my boy. And
      in this rehabilitation of the family name you have as much concern as I
      have&mdash;in fact more than I have&mdash;for you will enjoy even more
      than I shall the fame and wealth I am going to get out of this thing, for
      the family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where does the wealth come in, Albert? There is no money honestly to be
      made in politics.&rdquo; Seth had forgotten his earlier embarrassment now, and
      the spirit of dispute was rising within him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; said the elder brother, comfortably contemplating the
      rings of cigar smoke he was making, &ldquo;to the wise there is money
      everywhere. The word &lsquo;honesty&rsquo; in politics is a purely relative term, just
      as it is in your line, or in law, or in medicine. If we lawyers strictly
      graded our charges by the net value of our services to our clients, if
      doctors refused to make all calls upon patients that were not altogether
      necessary, and based their bills rigidly upon the actual good they had
      done&mdash;by George! the poor-houses would have to be enlarged. Take your
      own business, for instance, or I ought to call it a profession, too, I
      suppose. Are editors invariably candid with their readers, do you think?
      Do they always tell the disagreeable truth about people they make their
      money from? And don&rsquo;t they have an open hand behind the back about the
      same as other folks do? Occasionally, I admit, an ass like our brother
      John does drift into the profession, and retains his childhood belief that
      the moon is made of green cheese. But I have noticed that such fellows as
      he, who run their papers on an exalted moral plane, generally come around
      to borrow money from the ungodly, toward the close of the year, to make
      their accounts balance. I am sorry to see that John and Ansdell have
      filled your head with all this nonsense. A newspaper man tearing his shirt
      in defense of financial fastidiousness in politics presents rather a
      comical spectacle, if you only knew it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no right at all to say that!&rdquo; Seth answered hotly. &ldquo;I believe
      firmly that the newspaper men of this country, considering their influence
      and the great temptation to make money out of it, are as honest a body of
      men as you can find in America. This conventional talk about their
      venality is the cruellest kind of libel, and if you knew them as I do you
      wouldn&rsquo;t lend yourself to circulating it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am not entirely without acquaintance in this white-winged
      profession of yours,&rdquo; replied the lawyer, smilingly. &ldquo;I know Mr. Mortimer
      Samboye, for example. I could tell you too, you confiding youngster, just
      his figure, and where the cheque, made payable to his wife, was cashed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you do know about Samboye, you know what I believe to be the one
      exception to the rule in the State. I don&rsquo;t for a moment believe that
      there is another editor whom your people could have bought. It is an
      odious exception, to be sure, but exceptions prove the rule. If
      journalists and journals were in the market, as you and your machine
      friends seem to imagine, there would be no such widespread bolt against
      your machine ticket to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you think so, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer was getting vexed. He stood up, thrust his hands deep into his
      trowsers pockets, and spoke with more sharpness than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think so! Why, man alive, this same d&mdash;&mdash;d <i>Chronicle</i>
      of yours has been in the market since before you were born. I bet you
      to-day that Workman would rather plank out five thousand dollars from his
      own pocket than let me cross-examine him in the witness box on his
      recollections of the <i>Chronicle&rsquo;s</i> record. Why, that is the very last
      paper in the State that has a title to throw stones! Do you want to know
      when this new reforming zeal of Workman&rsquo;s was born? I can tell you. It was
      the day that another man (Dick Folts, if you wish names), was appointed to
      the Territorial Governorship that Workman wanted for his brother. So you
      thought it was only high morality and noble patriotic sentiments that
      ailed the <i>Chronicle</i>, did you? You never suspected that it was
      simply a bad case of brother&mdash;that it all happened because Samuel M.
      Workman of Toboggan was compelled to continue to adorn a private station?
      You think the world is run on kid-gloved, scriptural ethics? It reminds me
      of a novel I read here awhile ago. It set out to describe An American
      Politician&mdash;and in almost every scene in the book where he appeared,
      he was drinking tea in some lady&rsquo;s drawing room, declaiming to the fair
      sex on how he was going to reform politics. He thought he was a deuce of a
      fellow, and so did the women and the author too. This politician was a
      good sample of all your reformers. I tell you, the men who go to afternoon
      teas in America, exert no more influence on American politics than&mdash;than
      a hen who was too refined to scratch in the barn-yard for worms would
      exert on the question of female suffrage. Now <i>don&rsquo;t</i> make a fool of
      yourself, Seth. Your predecessor, Samboye, was in no way your equal&mdash;some
      fellow at the club once, I remember, just hit him off in a phrase which he
      had hunted up in the dictionary to sling at him: &lsquo;a nugipolyloquous
      numbskull &rsquo;&mdash;but he knew enough to feather his own nest, and
      to take men as they are, and not as the Prophet Jeremiah might think they
      ought to be. <i>Don&rsquo;t</i> make me angry with this pharisaical nonsense!
      You are very young yet. You will see things differently when you have
      rubbed up against the world a while longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth also stood up now, with his hands deep in his pockets&mdash;a trick
      of all the Fairchilds when they were excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no desire to make you angry,&rdquo; he answered, beginning with an
      effort at calmness, but soon raising his voice, &ldquo;and I shouldn&rsquo;t have
      dreamed of inflicting my juvenile views on you if you hadn&rsquo;t insisted,
      even to the point of a threat, on my coming here. I would rather not argue
      the thing at all. We regard politics from totally different standpoints. I
      believe that your methods and aims&mdash;by &lsquo;your&rsquo; I mean your wing of the
      party&mdash;are scandalous, corrupting and ruinous. I believe that if some
      check is not put upon the rule of the machine, if the drift of public
      acquiescence in debased processes of government is not stopped, it will
      soon be too late to save even the form of our institutions from the dry
      rot of venality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems to me I&rsquo;ve read all this. Don&rsquo;t work your old leaders off on me.
      Talk sense!&rdquo; said Albert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seth dropped rhetoric: &ldquo;All this is very real, very big, to me. To you it
      is impracticable and meaningless. You don&rsquo;t at all believe in the dangers
      which are so apparent to me. Perhaps if you did you wouldn&rsquo;t care. That is
      all right. I have no desire to convert you, or to debate the question with
      you. I simply want to explain that there is no community of premises,
      even, between us on this subject. As for your explanation of the motives
      underlying the <i>Chronicle&rsquo;s</i> attitude, I shan&rsquo;t contradict you. So
      far as I am concerned, the matter is not in argument. It is enough for me
      that we bolt the State ticket, and occupy the ground we do. It is no
      concern of mine by what path we got there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert had heard his brother through with contemptuous impatience. He said
      now, with one foot on the stove hearth, and in a voice which, by its very
      coldness of calm, ought to have warned Seth of the temper underlying it:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may bolt the State ticket as much as you d&mdash;&mdash;d please. I
      don&rsquo;t like your doing it, and it will injure you more than any efforts of
      mine can make good, but I can&rsquo;t help it, and it wasn&rsquo;t for that that I
      wanted to see you. But if you bolt <i>me</i>, Mr. Seth, or put so much as
      a straw in my path, by God! I&rsquo;ll grind you, and your paper, and everybody
      responsible for it, finer than tooth-powder! However&mdash;we will exhaust
      the other side of the subject first. I&rsquo;ve had it in mind for a long while,
      in fact ever since I first procured you a place there, to buy you a share
      in the <i>Chronicle</i>. Workman would be glad of the ready money&mdash;he
      itches for it as much as any living man&mdash;and it would be a good thing
      for you. Would you like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t told me yet what you dragged me up here, away from my work,
      for,&rdquo; said Seth. &ldquo;You presumably had an object of some sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you want to get down to business, do you? You shall have it, in a
      nutshell. I want you to see Ansdell, and get him to promise that if I beat
      him in the Convention he will support me squarely at the polls; I want you
      to get a pledge from Workman that the <i>Chronicle</i> will come out for
      me, solid, the day after I am nominated. <i>That&rsquo;s</i> what I want, and it
      is mighty little for <i>me</i> to ask of <i>you!</i> And you may tell
      Workman for me that if he and his paper give me the smallest ground for
      complaint, and waver in the least in backing me up, I&rsquo;ll start a paper in
      Tecumseh before Christmas that will crush the <i>Chronicle</i> out of
      sight. The paper is no good, anyway. I know hundreds of good citizens who
      would rejoice to have a decent substitute for it.&rdquo; The pride of the editor
      was wounded. &ldquo;You seem to worry a good deal about this worthless paper, at
      all events,&rdquo; he said, bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bandy words with me, youngster!&rdquo; cried Albert, scowling and pacing
      the floor. &ldquo;I want your answer, or the answer of your employer&mdash;yes
      or no! I&rsquo;ll have none of your impudence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth held his temper down. He could not help feeling that his brother,
      from the fraternal standpoint at least, had some pretty strong arguments
      on his side. He made answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have no influence with Ansdell, one way or the other, even if I
      talked with him. He knows his own business best, and if he has made up his
      mind to a certain course, nothing that I could say would move him. As for
      the <i>Chronicle</i> we&rsquo;ve kept our hands off, thus far, on your account,
      and we&rsquo;ve said nothing at all about your leading the Dearborn County
      delegates into the machine camp at the State Convention, although the
      whole rest of the State is ringing with it. But I am charged to say that
      that is as much as we can do. If you are nominated, we can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t
      support you. It is not a nice thing for me to have to say to you, but
      there&rsquo;s no good mincing matters. Besides, you know&mdash;there may be a
      way out of it; you may not be nominated to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All hell can&rsquo;t prevent it!&rdquo; The words came forth in an explosion of
      wrath. Albert stamped his foot and clenched his fists as Seth had never
      seen him do before. He tapped his breast three or four times,
      significantly, as if there were something in the pocket to which he was
      referring&mdash;Seth remembered the gesture long afterward&mdash;and
      repeated that his nomination was assured. He seemed to dislike his
      passion, and strive to restrain it, but the choleric vein between his
      brows grew more swollen, and his black, keen eyes flashed more angrily
      than ever, as he strode up and down before the stove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and I&rsquo;ll be elected too! All the white-livered hounds in Adams
      County, from my own brother up, shall not stop me! I&rsquo;ll stump the district
      every night and day till election. I&rsquo;ll speak in Tecumseh&mdash;yes, in
      Tecumseh, at the biggest meeting money and organisation can get together&mdash;and
      I&rsquo;ll handle this whole bolting business so&rsquo;s to warm the hearts of honest
      men all over the State. By God! I&rsquo;ll shake Workman as a terrier shakes a
      rat, in view and hearing of his whole community! Won&rsquo;t he squirm though!
      And won&rsquo;t the crowd enjoy having him shown up! And <i>you</i>&rdquo;&mdash;there
      followed some savage personal abuse, profane in form&mdash;&ldquo;after
      to-morrow morning, never let me lay eyes on you again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not for the pleasure of seeing you that I come here, ever,&rdquo; Seth
      retorted, the words coming quick and fierce. &ldquo;Be sure I&rsquo;d never trouble
      you again, if you were the only one in this house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer&rsquo;s eyes sparkled with a sardonic meaning, and Seth, as he saw
      it, bit his tongue with impatience at the thoughtless form of his speech;
      for he read in this cold, glancing light that nothing had been lost upon
      his brother&rsquo;s perception when he entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a full minute&rsquo;s silence, in which the two men faced each other.
      Albert was busy thinking how to put most effectively the things he was now
      moved to say. At last he spoke, coolly, incisively once more, while Seth,
      flushed and anxious, pretended to regulate the flame of the lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have no illusions about the motive of your visits to the farm. I
      am not blind; even if I were, others about the house are not. I am not
      going to say what you are doubtless expecting. I might point out to you
      that a young man who comes to a brother&rsquo;s house&mdash;I will say nothing
      of the debt of gratitude he owes him&mdash;and steals chances to make love
      to that brother&rsquo;s wife, is a pitiful cur. Stop!&rdquo;&mdash;for Seth had
      straightened himself angrily at this epithet, despite his consciousness of
      self-reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I repeat that I <i>might</i> say this&mdash;but I will not. I prefer to
      view it in another light. I don&rsquo;t think you are a knave. To be that
      requires intelligence. You are a fool,&mdash;a conceited, presumptuous,
      offensive fool. You set yourself up to judge <i>me</i>; you arrogate to
      yourself airs of moral superiority, and assume to regulate affairs of
      State by the light of your virtue and wisdom&mdash;and you have not brains
      enough meanwhile to take care of yourself against the cheapest wiles of a
      silly woman, who amuses herself with young simpletons just to kill time.
      You take upon yourself to lay down the law to a great National party&mdash;and
      you don&rsquo;t know enough to see through even so transparent a game as this.
      Get out of my sight! I have wasted too much time with you. It annoys me to
      think that such an idiot belongs to the family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert had rightly calculated that he could thus most deeply and surely
      wound Seth, but he was mistaken in his estimate of the nature of the
      response. If Seth&rsquo;s vanity was scalded by his brother&rsquo;s words, he at least
      didn&rsquo;t show it. But he did advance upon Albert with clenched fists, and
      gleaming eyes, and shout fiercely at him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man who will speak that way of his wife is a coward and a scoundrel!
      And if it is my cousin Isabel he means, he is a liar to boot! If you were
      not my brother&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were not, what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert waited a moment for the answer, which the conflict between Seth&rsquo;s
      rage and his half-guilty consciousness choked in the utterance, and then
      calmly turned on his heel and left the room, by the same outside door at
      which he had entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Seth went upstairs, he heard Isabel&rsquo;s door close softly. &ldquo;I wonder how
      much of it she heard?&rdquo; he said to himself.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI.&mdash;THE NIGHT: MASTER AND MAN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>LBERT walked
      across the yard toward the larger of the new stable buildings. It was a
      dry, warm, luminous night, radiant overhead with the glory of a whole
      studded heaven of stars. The moon, the full, shining-faced moon of
      October, would rise in an hour or so, and then would come pale mists along
      the valley bottom-lands, and perhaps clouds in the eastern sky. But one
      could walk bareheaded in this soft starlight now, without a fear of cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer paid no sort of attention to the night, but strode across the
      grass, swung himself over the stile, and pulled back the great stable
      door, creaking shrilly on its rollers, with angry energy. He stopped upon
      the threshold of the darkness, through which the shapes of carriages
      covered with white sheets vaguely loomed, and called out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Milton!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was the answering sound of footsteps overhead. A door at the top of
      the stairs was opened, and a flood of light illumined the staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ve got back, ay?&rdquo; said a voice from the top.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been Milton&rsquo;s idea, when the new buildings were erected, to achieve
      complete domestic autonomy by arranging for himself a residential room
      above the carriage place. The chamber was high and commodious. It had been
      lathed and plastered, and, in lieu of wall-paper, the sides were decorated
      with coarsely-colored circus bills, or pictures from sporting weeklies,
      all depicting women in tights. There was a good corded bed in one corner.
      Two chairs, a stained pine table on which, beside the lamp, were some
      newspapers, a little wood stove, and a mantel-shelf covered with tin-types
      and cheap photographs, completed the scene. Milton enjoyed living here
      greatly. It comported with his budding ideas of his own personal dignity,
      and it freed him from the disagreeable supervision which the elder Miss
      Fairchild was so prone to exercise over all who lived in the house. Only
      the Lawton girl, Melissa, came across the yard each forenoon, to tidy up
      the room, and chuckle over the pictures and the tastes which these, and
      the few books Milton from time to time brought home from a
      sporting-library at Thessaly, indicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky you hadn&rsquo;t gone to bed,&rdquo; said the lawyer, curtly, pulling his
      hat over his eyes to shade them from the flaring light, and sitting down.
      &ldquo;I was going to wake you up. What&rsquo;s your news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been over to Tyre twice to see Beekman, &rsquo;n&rsquo; no use. Once he
      wouldn&rsquo;t talk at all&mdash;jis&rsquo; kep his ole lantern-jaws tight shet, &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      said &rsquo;Ef Albert Fairchild wants to see me, he knaows where I kin be
      faound.&rsquo; Th&rsquo; other time he was more talkative&mdash;tried his best to fine
      aout what I was drivin&rsquo; at, but I couldn&rsquo;t git no satisfaction aout o&rsquo;
      him. He wouldn&rsquo;t bine himself to nothin&rsquo;. He jis&rsquo; stood off et arm&rsquo;s
      lenth, &rsquo;n&rsquo; sized up what I was a sayin&rsquo; in that dum sly way o&rsquo; his.
      I couldn&rsquo;t make head nor tail of him. He wouldn&rsquo;t say he would take money,
      &rsquo;n&rsquo; he wouldn&rsquo;t say he wouldn&rsquo;t. He wouldn&rsquo;t say yes or nao to th&rsquo;
      post office scheme, or anythin&rsquo; else. He jis&rsquo; kep&rsquo; his big eyes on me, as
      much as to say, &lsquo;You ketch a weasel asleep!&rsquo; &rsquo;n&rsquo; listened. Naow yeh
      knaow th&rsquo; hull of it. If yeh want anythin&rsquo; more done, yeh better do it
      yerself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer looked attentively at his hired man, and drummed with his
      fingers on the-table. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s all, is it? You are no further ahead with
      Beek-man than when the Convention adjourned? You&rsquo;ve got no proposition
      from him&mdash;no statement as to how he takes my proposals?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, Albert&mdash;jest it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something in Milton&rsquo;s tone seemed to annoy Albert even more than his
      confession of failure had done. He rose to his feet abruptly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      &lsquo;Albert&rsquo; me!&rdquo; he said, raising his voice out of its accustomed calm; &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t like it! You take too much upon yourself. But&mdash;I am to blame
      for it myself. I&rsquo;ve let you run things with too free a hand, and trusted
      affairs to you that I ought to have kept to myself. It is always my way,&rdquo;
       he went on, in petulant selfcriticism. &ldquo;I never did trust anybody who was
      worth the powder to blow him up. I ought to be used to it by this time.
      But to encounter two such fools in one evening&mdash;and this evening of
      all others, too&mdash;by George! it&rsquo;s enough to make a man strike his
      mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t no fool, Mister Fairchild&rdquo;&mdash;the hired man was standing up
      too, and his harsh tones gave the title an elaborate, almost ridiculous
      emphasis&mdash;&ldquo;&rsquo;n&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll thank yeh to keep yer tongue civil, tew!
      Ef yeh don&rsquo;t like my style, yeh kin git sum&rsquo;un else to do yer dirty work
      for yeh. I&rsquo;ve no hankerin&rsquo; fer it. I&rsquo;m hired to manage this farm, I am.
      Nothin&rsquo; was said &rsquo;baout my hevin&rsquo; to run a Congresshn&rsquo;l campaign
      into th&rsquo; bargain. I ain&rsquo;t sayin&rsquo; but what I kin do it&rsquo;s well&rsquo;s some other
      folks. I ain&rsquo;t sayin&rsquo; that it&rsquo;s beyon&rsquo; me. P&rsquo;raps I&rsquo;ve got my pull &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      this caounty, &rsquo;s well &rsquo;s some other people. P&rsquo;raps &rsquo;f
      I was amine to, I could knock somebuddy&rsquo;s game skyhigh, jis&rsquo; by liftin&rsquo; my
      little finger tomorrer. I ain&rsquo;t sayin&rsquo; I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to dew it. I ain&rsquo;t
      findin&rsquo; no fault with yeh. All I say is I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to take one ioty o&rsquo;
      slack from you, or anybody else, about this thing. You hear <i>me!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hired man had spoken aggressively and loudly, with his thumbs in the
      arm-holes of his vest, and his shaggy head well up in the air. He knew his
      employer pretty well, and had estimated with some precision the amount of
      impudence he would bear. This full measure he was not disposed to abate
      one atom. He had failed to buy the Jay County boss, or even to
      satisfactorily gauge his intentions, it was true, but that was no reason
      why he should submit to being called a fool by Albert Fairchild, who
      couldn&rsquo;t run his farm, let alone his Congressional campaign, without him.
      So the mean-figured, slouching countryman, with his cheap, ill-fitting
      clothes, frowzy beard, and rough, red hands truculently spread palm
      outward on his breast, stood his ground before the city lawyer and grinned
      defiance at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer did not immediately reply. He was not ordinarily at a loss for
      words or decisions in his dealings with men, but this rude, uncouth
      rustic, with his confident air and his fund of primordial cunning, puzzled
      him. There was some uneasiness in the feeling, too, for he could not
      remember the exact limits of his confidences with Milton. Moreover he
      could not afford, at any price, to quarrel with him now on the eve of the
      Convention. &ldquo;After the election we&rsquo;ll clip your wings, my fine fellow,&rdquo; he
      thought to himself, but he gave the words upon which he finally decided a
      kindlier turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I hear you. Almost anybody on the side-hill could, the way you are
      talking. There is no reason why you should lose your temper. If you
      couldn&rsquo;t fix Beekman, why that&rsquo;s all there is to it. We must go at it in a
      different way. I can see through him. He&rsquo;s standing out for a cash
      payment. The old fox wants money down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve got it fur him, hain&rsquo;t yeh? Go &rsquo;n&rsquo; give it to him,
      straight aout!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s it&mdash;I wanted you to bring back an idea of his figure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His figger. How much hev yeh got?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind that&mdash;it&rsquo;s a d&mdash;&mdash;d sight more than the office
      is worth; but when a man gets into a fight of this sort, he&rsquo;s got to force
      his way through, cost or no cost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Air yeh sure it can&rsquo;t be traced? Wuz yeh careful to raise it so nobuddy
      cud spot yeh, and give aout that yeh got so much money together for
      purposes o&rsquo; bribery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is perfectly safe. There is no record.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;N&rsquo; nobuddy on airth knaows yeh&rsquo;ve got th&rsquo; money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a living soul!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men communed together as to the importance of immediate action.
      The Convention was to reassemble at Tyre, fifteen miles away, at eleven
      the following forenoon. The political master of Jay County, Abe Beekman,
      who held in his hands the deciding power, lived near Tyre, but in the
      valley some miles further on. The first train from Thessaly in the morning
      would be too late, for Beekman would have already arrived on the ground at
      Tyre, coming from the opposite direction, and would have begun work on his
      own hook. He must be seen at his home, early in the morning. The question
      was&mdash;how to encompass this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might drive across to-night,&rdquo; Albert suggested; &ldquo;it can&rsquo;t be more
      than twenty miles. It&rsquo;s a bad, up-hill road, but four or five hours ought
      to do it, easily enough. By George&mdash;I believe I&rsquo;ll go myself&mdash;start
      at once, see Beekman about daybreak, and then come back to Tyre by
      breakfast time; as if I had just driven over from here. No one will
      suspect a thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, thet&rsquo;s a fust-rate idee,&rdquo; assented Milton; &ldquo;only be keerful &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      put yer money in a safe place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer again slapped his breast with a confident &ldquo;Never fear about
      that,&rdquo; and went to the house to get some wraps for the night ride, leaving
      Milton to harness the grays, and drag out the sidebar buggy with the pole.
      The hired-man hummed to himself as he moved quietly, dextrously in the
      semi-darkness in the performance of this task.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert returned, just as the hame straps were being buckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody seems to be asleep in the house,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If they ask any
      questions in the morning, mind you know nothing whatever. That brother of
      mine is no friend. Be careful what you say to him. Let him walk to the
      depot in the morning. It&rsquo;ll do him good. Oh yes, by the way, better let me
      have one of those revolvers of yours&mdash;you have &rsquo;em upstairs,
      haven&rsquo;t you&mdash;give me the one that strikes fire every time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Milton came down and out presently, saying that he just remembered having
      lent the weapon. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tother&rsquo;s no good,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;yeh don&rsquo;t need no
      pistol anyway. Th&rsquo; moon&rsquo;ll be up direc&rsquo;ly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert gathered up the lines, and drove out slowly toward the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yeh better save th&rsquo; beasts till after yeh git over Tallman&rsquo;s hill, &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      rest &rsquo;em there by th&rsquo; gulf!&rdquo; Milton called after him, as a last
      injunction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hired man stood at the stable door, and watched the buggy pass the
      darkened, silent house, turn out on the high-road, and disappear beneath
      the poplars. The moon was just coming up, beyond this line of trees, and
      it made the gloom of their shadow deeper. His eyes, from following the
      vehicle ranged back to the house, which reared itself black against the
      whitening sky. There was there no sound, nor any sign of life. He took a
      revolver out of his pocket, and examined it in the starlight, cocking it
      again and again to make sure that there had been no mistake. Satisfied
      with the inspection, he put it back in his side coat-pocket. He went
      upstairs, changed his hat, took a drink out of a flat brown bottle in his
      cupboard, and spent a minute or two looking at one of the tin-type
      portraits on the mantel-shelf. He held the picture to the light, and
      grinned as he gazed&mdash;then put it in his breast pocket, blew out the
      lamp, and felt his way softly down stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later he came out from the stable, leading the swift black
      mare. She was saddled and bridled, and seemed to understand, as he led her
      over the grass, that he wanted no noise made. The man and beast, throwing
      long, grotesque shadows on the lawn, in the light of the low moon, stole
      past the house, and out upon the road. Milton here climbed into the
      saddle, and with an exultant little cluck, started in the direction his
      master had gone, still keeping the black mare on the grass. They, too,
      disappeared under the poplars.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon mounted into the heavens, pushing aside the aspiring clouds which
      sought to dispute her passage, then clothing them in her own livery of
      light, and drawing them upward after her, in a glittering train of
      attendance. All over the hill-side the calm radiance rested. The gay hues
      with which autumn&rsquo;s day brush painted the woods, the hedge rows, the long
      stretches of orchard, stubble, and field, sought now to only hint at their
      beauty, as they yielded new outlines, mystic suggestions of form and
      color, in the soft gray picture of mezzotint. Thin films of vapor rose to
      enwrap the feet of the dark firs, nearer to the sky, and in the valley
      below the silver of the moonlight lost itself on the frost-like whiteness
      of the gathering mist. It was a night for the young to walk together, and
      read love&rsquo;s purest, happiest thoughts in each other&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;for the
      old to drink in with thankful confession the faith that the world was
      still gracious and good.

      Milton was walking the mare now, still on the grass. He could hear the
      sound of wheels, just ahead.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII.&mdash;THE NIGHT: THE LOVERS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>eth had gone up to
      his room in a state of wretchedness which, seeming insupportable at the
      outset, had grown steadily worse upon reflection. He said to himself that
      he had never before in his whole life been so humiliated and unhappy, and
      then smiled with pitying contempt for the inadequacy of such a statement
      of the case. One&rsquo;s career must have been titanic in its tragic experiences
      to warrant such a comparison. &ldquo;I have never known before what suffering
      was,&rdquo; he thought, as he paced up and down his little room, scourging
      himself with the lash of bitter reflections.
    </p>
    <p>
      To try to sleep did not enter his head. He sat for a long time on the side
      of the bed, seeking to evolve something like order from the chaos of his
      wits, but he could not think. Had he tried to write, to discuss the thing
      in a letter, the simple familiar operation of the pen might have led him
      out of the <i>cul de sac</i>. As it was, whichever turn his mind sought to
      take, there rose an impassable barrier of shame, or rage or
      self-recrimination. In whatever light he tried to view the situation, it
      was all pain. He had been curtly, cruelly thrown off by his brother&mdash;the
      man to whom he owed everything&mdash;and he had had to listen to the most
      cutting, insulting language from this brother before they parted. Then, as
      he clenched his fists and fumed with impotent anger at the recollection of
      this language, there would come to divert this wrath, and turn it back
      upon himself, the facts that he had interposed his own boyish vanity and
      conceit to balk this brother&rsquo;s purposes, and had been caught trembling on
      the very brink of making love to this brother&rsquo;s wife. Did he not richly
      merit Albert&rsquo;s scorn? He could remember&mdash;should he ever forget?&mdash;the
      exact words of Albert&rsquo;s contemptuous characterization: &ldquo;A conceited,
      presumptuous, offensive fool.&rdquo; Did he not deserve them all? He owed this
      brother everything: the honest boy insisted upon saying this to himself
      over and over again, as the basis of all argument on the subject; the
      opportunity came for him to repay something of this debt. How had he
      improved it? By setting himself up to oppose this brother in the chief
      object of his life, and, as if this were not enough, by yielding weakly to
      the temptation to rob him of his domestic honor as well! &ldquo;I must be a
      villain as well as a fool, must I!&rdquo; the youngster growled between his set
      teeth, as he threw himself from the bed, and began the gloomy pacing up
      and down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not lighted his lamp. The soft half-darkness of the starlight,
      sufficing barely to render objects visible in the room, suited his mood.
      He heard the sound of wheels now on the gravel below. Looking out, he
      could see that the grays were being driven out; as they turned the corner
      of the house, the full moonlight fell upon them and the carriage, and Seth
      saw distinctly that it was his brother who was driving, and that he was
      wrapped as for an all-night ride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t even stay under the same roof with me!&rdquo; he said half-aloud, with
      a fresh bitterness of self-accusation&mdash;and then the torment of
      reproaching voices began in his breast again.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he turned from the window he heard a low rapping at his door; a minute
      later, he heard Isabel&rsquo;s voice, almost a whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seth! Don&rsquo;t open the door, but tell me, who was it that went out with the
      carriage just now? I heard it, but from my window I could see nothing. Was
      it <i>he?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth answered, as calmly as he could: &ldquo;Yes, I am sure of it. I recognized
      him.&rdquo; He stood close to the door, and the thought that only the thin pine
      panels divided him from her was uppermost in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a little pause. Once his hand involuntarily moved toward the
      latch, but he drew it back. Then she spoke again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had a terrible quarrel, didn&rsquo;t you, and all for me! I heard your
      answer, Seth, way up here. How nobly you spoke! It went straight to my
      heart, to hear his brutality rebuked in that manly way. I shan&rsquo;t forget
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s silence; then she whispered with a lingering
      softness, &ldquo;Good night!&rdquo; and he heard the faint rustling of her garments
      down the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brief as the interruption was, it had changed the whole spirit of his
      thoughts. The vindictive accusing demons had vanished, and left no more
      than a numbing sense of past torture in his breast. The anguish of
      self-condemnation, the crushing burden of self-humiliation, had passed
      away. The moonlight, as it spread over the slope toward Thessaly village,
      seemed to bring healing in its peaceful radiance. His own provocation grew
      mountain high; his brother&rsquo;s justification for his insults and barbarity
      diminished. &ldquo;I was doing only my duty in opposing him,&rdquo; he said
      confidently, and there was no voice of dissent now. &ldquo;Still more was I
      right in defending poor Isabel from his unmanly imputations. If a man is
      incapable of appreciating such a wife&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not follow out his thought, but surrendered himself instead to
      calling up, and enjoying in detail, the sweet scene which Albert&rsquo;s coming
      had so rudely broken into. How delicious it all was, as fancy now limned
      its outlines&mdash;yet not all the dainty graces of imagination and memory
      could reproduce in its full charm the original. He could think, and think,
      until the whole room seemed instinct with her presence, but how poor a
      counterfeit it all was, lacking the perfume of her hair and laces, the
      deep, languorous glow of her eyes, the thrilling melody of her low voice.
      The tender, caressing prolongation of syllables in that whispered &ldquo;good
      night&rdquo; made soft soul-music still in his ears. The insane thought&mdash;he
      did not dare ask himself if it were also a hope&mdash;that she might come
      again, took possession of him, and he stood for a long time close by the
      door, listening, waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was while Seth stood thus, seeing only with the eyes of the mind, that
      Milton stole past on the grass below, with the black mare, on his mission
      of murder. Had the young man been at the window instead, much that
      followed might have been different.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seth stood at the door for what seemed to him a long time, until gradually
      the futility of the action became apparent to him. &ldquo;Of course she would
      not come!&rdquo; he said, and resumed his pacing once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Faust-like vision began to dance before his eyes again, but with a
      witchery now which was uncanny. The calm of waiting had brought him enough
      strength of control to feel the presence of the cloven hoof in it all. The
      temptation was more urgent, strenuous than ever, but he was conscious of a
      deeper, more dogged spirit of resistance within him than ever, as well.
      There was no renewal of the savage, chaotic war of emotions under which he
      had suffered at the outset, groaning in the self-infliction of purposeless
      pain. This was a definite, almost scientific, struggle between two
      distinct forces, and though they fought their battle with all manner of
      sophistical weapons, and employed feints, pretended retreats and false
      advances in highest strategical form, he was never deceived for a moment
      as to which was the bad and which the good.
    </p>
    <p>
      The issue forced itself upon him, finally, with a demand for decision
      which was imperative. He could stay no longer in his room. There was
      neither sleep nor rest of any kind there for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to the door, and opened it. Through the blackness he could see a
      faint vertical line of light at the front end of the low hall, as of a
      lamp burning, and a door left ajar. The yellow ray gleamed as he looked at
      it, and seemed to wave itself in fascinating motions of enticement. He
      stood for a moment undecided, all his impulses strongly swaying towards
      the temptation, all his resisting reasons growing weaker in their
      obstruction, and some even turning coward, and whispering, as they laid
      down their arms, &ldquo;After all, youth has its rights.&rdquo; Then he squared his
      shoulders, with the old gesture of resolution, and walked steadily away
      from the line of light, down the stairs, and out of the door, bareheaded
      under the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had walked for a long, long time, before he became conscious that he
      had left his hat behind. The night air was exceptionally mild for the
      season, but it grew cool enough to bring this fact to his notice. As he
      put his hand to his head, and stopped short at the discovery, his whole
      mind seemed to clarify itself. He had been walking aimlessly, almost
      unconsciously&mdash;it must have been for much more than an hour. In a
      vague way, he knew where his steps had led him. He had walked through the
      orchard to his mother&rsquo;s grave, and stood for some time by the brier-clad
      wall and fence which surrounded it, thinking of his boyhood, and of her.
      Then he had struck across through Sir Thomas&rsquo;s pasture, to the main road;
      thence by the way of the school-house, and skirting the hill, to the
      Burfield road, at the farthermost end of the line of poplars.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he stopped here now collecting his thoughts, awakening himself as it
      were, the sound of chorussinging reached him, faint at first, then growing
      more distinct. A wagon-load of young people were returning from Leander
      Crump&rsquo;s husking, enjoying themselves in the fair moonlight. From the
      sounds, they must have been about in front of the Fairchild homestead, and
      they were coming rapidly toward Seth. If he remained in the road, they
      must pass and recognize him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a division line of thorn hedge, long since grown into tall young
      trees, coming to the road here, and a path beside it leading to a rude
      stile in the turnpike fence. This path went straight to Mrs. Warren&rsquo;s
      house, as Seth had known from boyhood, but he gave this no thought as he
      stepped over the stile, and moved along in the shadow of the thorns. He
      walked a score of yards or so, and then stepped closer into the obscurity
      of the hedge, to wait till the hay-wagon and its caroling crew had passed
      by on the road outside. He was feeling very cold now, and tired to boot,
      and said to himself that as soon as the road was clear he would go home
      and go to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his surprise the singing came to an abrupt halt, just as the wagon
      approached the end of the hedge.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a chorus of merry &ldquo;whoas!&rdquo; as the horses drew up, and through
      the clear air Seth could hear a confused babel of voices, all jovially
      discussing something. One male voice, louder than the rest, called out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better let me come along with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was some giggling audible, out of which rose a clear, fresh girlish
      voice which Seth knew:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thanks! I can cut across by this path in less than no time. I&rsquo;m not
      afraid. The tramps are all abed and asleep by this time, like other honest
      people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With more laughter, and a salvo of &ldquo;good nights!&rdquo; the wagon started off
      again, and Annie Fairchild, singing lightly to herself the refrain of the
      chorus, and holding her face up to catch the full radiance of the
      moonlight, came walking briskly down the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite her valiant confidence the young woman gave a visible start of
      alarm as Seth stepped out from the shadows to speak to her. She threw
      herself forward as if to run, then looked again, stopped, and then gave a
      little tremulous laugh, and cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Seth! is that you. Mercy! How you frightened me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could think of nothing better than a feeble parody of her words: &ldquo;Yes,
      it is time all honest people were abed and asleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said this with a half-smile, but the girl&rsquo;s face grew more serious
      still as she looked at her cousin. She spoke eagerly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter with you to-night? Where is your hat? You look as
      white as a ghost! Oh&mdash;have you come from our house? Is it something
      about grandmother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s nothing about her. I haven&rsquo;t been nearer your place than this. I
      only stepped in here so as to avoid the wagon. I didn&rsquo;t want them to see
      me like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why should you <i>be</i> like this? Now, Seth, I know something <i>has</i>
      happened. What is it? Am I wanted? Can I do anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me walk with you to your house,&rdquo; he said, and they turned together
      down the path. &ldquo;Something <i>has</i> happened. I don&rsquo;t know that I can
      tell you what it is, but only to be with you like this rests and comforts
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was walking in the shadow; the strong light, which only tipped his
      shoulder occasionally, enveloped her. He watched her furtively as they
      moved along, and, just in proportion as he found relief and solace in the
      contemplation of her clear, frank, serene face, he shrank from confiding
      his own weak woes to her. But, as he said, it was a comfort to be with
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had walked almost to within sight of the Warren farmhouse before he
      broke the silence. She had scarcely looked at him since they started, but
      kept her gray eyes straight ahead, as if viewing some fixed, distant
      object. Her lips were tightly pressed together&mdash;the only sign of
      emotion on her face&mdash;and this proof that she was hard at work
      thinking tended further to embarrass him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I truly don&rsquo;t know how to tell you, Annie,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;But Albert
      and I have&mdash;have had words together; in fact&mdash;we&rsquo;ve quarrelled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her lips quivered a little. She did not turn her face toward him, but
      said, nervously: &ldquo;I have been expecting that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth did not ask himself the cause of his cousin&rsquo;s anticipatory
      confidence, but went on gloomily: &ldquo;Well, it has come. We had it out, this
      evening, to the very last word. And then, as if that were not enough, the
      devil himself got hold of me afterward, and tugged and tore at me to&mdash;but
      I can&rsquo;t tell you <i>that</i>. I can scarcely realize myself what I&rsquo;ve been
      through this night. Why, I&rsquo;ve been wandering about here on the hill-side
      for hours, not knowing where I was going, or even what I was thinking of,
      like a mad man. You can see how my hands are scratched, and my clothes
      torn; that is from the berry-bushes, I suppose, up by mother&rsquo;s grave. I
      remember being there. I didn&rsquo;t even know that my head was bare, until just
      before the wagon came up.&rdquo; Before this remarkable recital of insane
      things, Annie was properly silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seth added, after a pause, &ldquo;But it is all over now. And I can&rsquo;t tell you,
      you can&rsquo;t begin to guess, how it brings me to my senses, and soothes and
      restores me to have met you like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he paused suddenly, they both turned to listen and look. From the knoll
      to the east, where the turnpike ran through a cutting, there came a
      curiously muffled sound, like yet unlike the first measured drumming of a
      partridge. It swelled a second later into something more definite, as they
      saw a dark horse, the rider crouching low over its neck, galloping like
      the wind along the high-road toward Thessaly. The pace was something
      prodigious&mdash;the horse had vanished like an apparition before they
      could look twice. But there had been nothing like a commensurate volume of
      sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The horse was running on the grass beside the road,&rdquo; Seth remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably going for a doctor,&rdquo; was her comment. &ldquo;I wonder who is ill!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looked to me more like the headless horseman than a sick-messenger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he said this, and they turned to walk again, his face lighted up once
      more. The thought seemed to please him, and he smiled on her as he added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me be superstitious enough to fancy that the thing which just flashed
      by, in a rumble of low thunder, was the demon that has been torturing me
      all this while. We will say that he has been defeated, baffled, and has
      fled in despair, and that&rdquo;&mdash;he looked still more smilingly at her&mdash;&ldquo;the
      fiend has been beaten and driven away by you. Do you know, Annie, that
      here in this lovely light you are the very picture of a good angel?
      Perhaps angels don&rsquo;t wear seal-skin cloaks, or have such red cheeks, but
      if they knew how becoming they were, they would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annie&rsquo;s face, which had been immobile in thought, softened a little. She
      was accustomed to her cousin&rsquo;s hyperbole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am delighted if you feel better,&rdquo; she laughed back. &ldquo;But it is no
      credit specially to me. Contact with any other rational human being would
      probably have had the same effect upon you. If I had helped you in any
      way, or advised you, perhaps I might own the angelic impeachment. But I
      don&rsquo;t even know the first thing about your trouble, except that you&rsquo;ve
      quarrelled with Albert, and&mdash;and had a temptation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had begun gayly enough, but she uttered the last words soberly, almost
      gravely. Instinct and observation alike told her that Seth&rsquo;s experiences
      had been of a deeply serious nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sighed heavily, and looked on the ground. How much could he tell her?&mdash;in
      what words should he put it? Even as he sought in his mind for safe and
      suitable phrases, an Idea&mdash;a great, luminous, magnificent Idea&mdash;unfolded
      itself before his mental vision. It was not new to him&mdash;years ago he
      had often entertained and even nourished it&mdash;yet it had been hidden,
      dormant so long, and it burst forth now so grandly transformed and
      altered, that for an instant he stopped abruptly, and put his hand to his
      breast as if to catch his breath. Then he walked on again, still with his
      eyes on the ground. He fancied that he was meditating; instead, he was
      marvelling at the apotheosized aptness of the Providence which had sent
      this Idea at just this time, and swearing grateful fealty to it with all
      the earnestness of his being.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up at last, and drew her arm through his. They were near the
      house now. &ldquo;I am going to make a clean breast of it, Annie,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If
      I have not finished when we get to the bars, shall we turn back? I want
      you to hear it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is pretty late, Seth,&rdquo; she said, but neither in tone, nor in the
      manner in which she allowed her arm to be taken, was there the kind of
      refusal which dismays.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no need now to seek words. They came fast, keeping pace with the
      surge of his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Annie,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I have been as near the gates of hell to-night as it
      is given to a man to go, and bring back his soul. I have fancied all this
      while that I was strong because I was successful; that I was courageous
      because I happened to be clever. I found myself put to the test to-night,
      and I was weak as water. I am afraid of myself. More, I have been making a
      fool of myself. I know now the measure of my weakness. I have the brains,
      perhaps, but I have no balance-wheel. I fly off; I do insensate things; I
      throw myself away. I need a strong, sweet, wise nature to lean upon, to
      draw inspiration from. Oh if you could realize the peace, the happiness
      your simple presence brought me this evening! I haven&rsquo;t said it yet,
      Annie, but you have guessed it&mdash;I want to pledge myself to you, to
      swear that you are to be my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl had drawn her arm from his before the last sentence was finished,
      and stood facing him. They were within call of the house, but she did not
      offer to renew the walk. She answered him with no trace of excitement,
      looking him candidly in the face:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sure just how to answer you, Seth. Hardly any girl would know, I
      think, how to treat such a declaration as that. Wait a moment&mdash;let me
      finish! In the first place, I am in doubt whether I ought to treat it
      seriously at all. You are disturbed, excited, to-night; when we first met
      you looked and acted like a madman. And then again&mdash;understand, I am
      trying to talk to you as a friend of all your life, instead of a mere girl
      acquaintance&mdash;I would not marry any man who I did not firmly believe
      loved me. You have not even pretended that you love me. You have simply
      complimented me on my disposition, and pledged yourself to a partnership
      in which I was to be a balance-wheel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are laughing at me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Seth, my dear cousin, not at all. I am only showing you the exact
      situation. You are too excited, or too unpractical, to see it for
      yourself. You talk now about being at the gates of hell and expressions
      like that&mdash;wild words which signify only that you have had trouble
      during the evening. I fancy that all men are apt to exaggerate such things&mdash;I
      <i>know</i> you are. Why, do you even know what trouble is? Have <i>I</i>
      had no trouble? Have I not lived a whole life of trial here with a
      bed-ridden invalid? And there are other things that&mdash;that I might
      speak of, if I chose to complain. For instance&rdquo;&mdash;her face brightened
      as she spoke, now, and a suggestion of archness twinkled in her eyes&mdash;&ldquo;was
      it not a terrible thing that I should have waded into the water, that day
      of the fishing party, and got you out all by myself, and then heard the
      credit coolly given to another&mdash;person, who never got so much as the
      soles of her shoes wet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annie had begun seriously enough, but the softness of her real mood toward
      her cousin, together with the woman&rsquo;s natural desire to have justice done
      her in affairs of the heart, had led her into a halfplayful revelation of
      pique. Seth would have answered here, but she held up her hand, and went
      on: &ldquo;Wait till I am through. You didn&rsquo;t know the truth in that matter of
      the log-jam. I understand that. There are a good many other things the
      truth of which you don&rsquo;t know. You don&rsquo;t, for instance, know the real
      facts about your own mind. You have had trouble to-night&mdash;for all
      your talk about making a clean breast of it you haven&rsquo;t told me yet what
      it was&mdash;and your imagination makes a mountain out of what was
      probably a molehill, and you straightway rush off bareheaded to wander
      about like a ghost, and frighten people out of their wits; and then,
      happening to meet a girl who, by the deceptive light of the moon, looks as
      if she had some sense about her, you take without consideration the most
      important step a man can take in his whole life. Isn&rsquo;t that a fair
      statement of the case? And, thinking it all over, don&rsquo;t you agree with me
      that you would better tie my handkerchief about your head and go home and
      go to bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth laughed&mdash;a reluctant, in-spite-of-himself laugh. &ldquo;You always
      would make fun of me when I tried to be serious. But if I ever <i>was</i>
      serious in my life, it is now. Listen to me, Annie! It is not my fault if
      I see you now, truly as you are, for the first time. I have been a fool. I
      know it I said so at the start. But a man is the creature of
      circumstances, you know. Things have happened tonight which have opened my
      eyes. I realize now that you have been closest to my heart all the while,
      that I have loved you all&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annie stopped him, with her hand upon his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to finish that to-night. Please don&rsquo;t, Seth. It would
      not be fair to me&mdash;or to yourself. Perhaps some other time when you
      have thought it over calmly&mdash;we will talk about it&mdash;that is, if
      you are of the same mind. If you are not, why, everything shall be just as
      it was before. And more than that, Seth, you&mdash;you mustn&rsquo;t feel in the
      least bound by what has been said to-night. You know that I am older than
      you&mdash;two whole months! That isn&rsquo;t as much as four years&rdquo;&mdash;the
      meekest of her sex could scarcely have foregone that shaft&mdash;&ldquo;but it
      gives me some sort of authority over you. And I am going to use it for
      your good. If it becomes necessary, I shall treat you like a perverse
      little boy, who doesn&rsquo;t in the least know what is good for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no discouragement to Seth in the tones of her speech, however
      non-committal its text might be. He put his arm about her and murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To think that I never <i>knew</i> until now! Ah, you make me very happy,
      Annie. And shall you be happy, too, do you think, happier than if we
      hadn&rsquo;t met?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled as she disengaged herself, and gave him both hands to say that
      they must separate: &ldquo;Happier at least than on the night of the fishing
      party. I cried myself to sleep that night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth found the house wholly dark, upon his return. He had no difficulty in
      getting to sleep, and his heavy slumber lasted until long after the
      breakfast hour the following forenoon.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII.&mdash;THE CONVENTION: THE BOSS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>yre had seen
      better days. In the noble old time of stage coaches it had been a
      thriving, almost bustling place, with mills turning out wares celebrated
      through all the section, with a starch factory which literally gave the
      name of the town to its product as a standard of excellence, and with
      taverns which were rarely left with a vacant room more than a day at a
      time. In those days it had been a power in politics too. The old
      court-house which frowned now upon the village green, elbowing the more
      modern brick jail out of public sight, was supposed to have echoed in its
      time about the tallest eloquence that any court-house in the State had
      heard. From Tyre had come to Albany, and Washington as well, a whole
      cluster of strong, shrewd, stalwart-tongued politicians, who forced their
      way to speakerships, and judgeships, and even senatorships, like veritable
      sons of Anak. It was a Tyre man who had beaten Aaron Burr in such and such
      a memorable contest. It was another Tyre man who, by assuming lead of the
      distracted Bucktails at a certain crucial period, had defeated sundry
      machinations of the Clintonians, and sounded the death-knell of their
      hopes. There was a Tyre man in the Regency, of course, and he is popularly
      believed, at least in Jay County, to have held that storied syndicate up
      by the tail, so to speak, years after it would otherwise have collapsed.
      At every State Convention, in this fine old time, inferior politicians
      from other sections dissembled their appetites until Tyre had been fed to
      satiety. And in the sowing season of politics, when far-seeing candidates
      began arranging for a share in the autumn harvest of offices, no aspirant
      felt that his seed had a chance of sprouting until he had paid a
      pilgrimage to Tyre, and invoked the mercy, if he could not have the
      smiles, of the magnates there.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was due doubtless to the traditions of these visits, when Judge Gould,
      the hero of the great Biggs murder case, would be at the Nedahma House,
      and Senator Yates, who unravelled and dragged to the pitiless light the
      masonic plot to blow up Mount Vernon, was to be found at the turnpike
      tavern, and both would keep pretty well in-doors toward evening because
      Colonel De Lancey, who had shot four men before Hamilton&rsquo;s death
      discredited duelling, was in town on private business&mdash;it was no
      doubt due to these memories that Tyre kept up its political tastes and, in
      a faded way, its political prestige, long after its material importance
      and interest had vanished. The mills were remembered now only by the
      widened reaches in the stream where their dams had once been; the starch
      factory was a dismantled ruin, from which what woodwork the lightning had
      spared had long since been abstracted for fuel; one of the taverns was now
      a private dwelling, and the other two neither profited themselves nor
      pleased the wives of the village by their dependence upon local custom.
      But the men of Tyre were still intense politicians. Indeed their known
      virulence had given to their county sobriquet of Jayhawker an almost
      national fame. Nowhere else in the State, proportionately, were so many
      weekly partisan papers taken&mdash;not tame, dispassionate prints, but the
      fire-eaters of both party presses, with incessant harrowing accounts of
      peaceful and confiding negroes being massacred in the South, on the one
      side, answered regularly on the other by long imposing tables of the money
      stolen by notorious criminals in the public service. This was the meat
      Tyre fed on, and contending editors could not serve it out too rank or
      highly peppered for its taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one excitement of Tyre too&mdash;far transcending the county fair,
      which had only interested them casually, and which they had seen moved
      over to Sidon, on the line of the newly-extended railroad, without a
      protest&mdash;was a political convention. There would be such a crowd
      about the Court House then as scarcely the spectacle of its being consumed
      by flames could draw at another time. The freeholders of Tyre paid much
      more than their fair share of county taxes; they knew it, and did not
      grumble at the injustice. In fact it rather pleased them than otherwise to
      see their town rated on the Supervisor&rsquo;s assessment-rolls according to its
      ancient wealth; the amercement was a testimonial to their dignity. Upstart
      towns like Sidon might wrangle over a few hundred dollars, and cheapen
      their valuation in the public eye by unworthy tricks; Tyre would have none
      of such small doings; it would preserve a genteel exterior, even if it had
      to eat pork grease on its buckwheat cakes in domestic seclusion. But if
      there had been so much as a hint about holding a county convention
      anywhere else than in the Tyre Court House&mdash;then, to use Abe
      Beekman&rsquo;s homely expression, you would have seen the fur fly! Other towns
      might indulge their modern and mercenary tastes in county fairs,
      railroads, gas, reservoirs and the like, to their hearts&rsquo; content, but
      they must keep their hands off political conventions. He would be a brazen
      Jayhawker indeed who should question Tyre&rsquo;s monopoly of these!
    </p>
    <p>
      So new generations of county politicians followed precedent without
      thought of murmuring, and accepted the discomforts of jolting in crowded
      democrat-wagons over the stony, bleak hills to Tyre, of eating cold, bad
      dinners in the smoke-dried, draughty barracks which had once been hotels,
      of drinking limed well-water with the unspeakable whiskey&mdash;as natural
      consequences of being interested in the public affairs of the nation. This
      resignation of other Jay County towns to the convention claims of Tyre
      swelled into a spirit of truculent defence every two years, when the
      question of a joint Congressional gathering for all three counties of the
      district came up. Precisely what would have happened if the bigger shires
      of Dearborn and Adams had combined in a refusal to come to Tyre, I am not
      bold enough to guess. The general feeling would probably have been that a
      crisis had arisen in which Jay County could do no less than dissolve her
      relations with the Federal Union.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately no such menace of secession and civil war was ever suffered to
      rise glowering on the horizon. Abe Beekman, the boss of Jay County, always
      managed to have Tyre designated by the District Committee, and the
      politicians from Dearborn and Adams amiably agreed to console themselves
      for the nuisances of the trip by getting as much fun out of it as was
      possible&mdash;which, reduced to details, meant bringing their own
      whiskey, sternly avoiding the dangerous local well-water, and throwing at
      each other during the dinner scramble such elements of the repast as
      failed to attract their metropolitan tastes. This procedure was not
      altogether to the liking of the Tyre landlords, who, however, compensated
      themselves for the diminution of the bar traffic and the havoc wrought in
      the dining room, by quadrupling their accustomed prices; and the invasion
      of boisterous aliens had its seamy side for the women of the place, who
      found it to the advantage of their dignity to stop indoors during the day
      which their husbands and fathers consecrated to the service of the
      Republic. But Tyre as a whole was proud and gratified.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning when the adjourned District Convention was to reassemble,
      political interest throbbed with feverish quickness in all the pulses of
      Tyre.
    </p>
    <p>
      The town could remember many a desperate and stirring combat on its
      well-worn battle-field, but never such a resolute, prolonged, and
      altogether delightful contest as this. The fight had its historic side,
      too. Every voter in Tyre could remember, or had been taught in all its
      details about, the famous struggle of the wet fall of &rsquo;34, when
      Hiram Chesney, the Warwick of Jay County then, locked horns with the elder
      Seth Fairchild of Dearborn, and, to pursue the local phraseology, they
      pawed up more earth in their fierce encounter than would dam the Nedahma
      creek. Poor Hiram had finally been worsted, falling ignobly on his native
      stamping ground, before the eyes of his own people. He had long since
      passed away, as Warwicks should when their king-making sinews have lost
      their strength. But another boss, perhaps in some ways a greater boss, had
      arisen in Jay County, in the person of Abram K. Beekman, and now, nearly
      half a century later, he was to try conclusions with a second Fairchild of
      Dearborn&mdash;a grandson of the hero of &rsquo;34. They had grappled
      once, a fortnight before, and had had to separate again, after an all-day
      tug, with a fall credited to neither. Now, in a few hours, they were to
      confront each other once more. What wonder that Tyre was excited!
    </p>
    <p>
      The two gladiators had been the observed of all observers during the
      preliminary skirmish. Tyre was almost disposed to fancy the Dearborn man.
      In his portly, black-clad figure, his round, close-shaven, aquiline face,
      and his professional capacity for oratory, he had recalled pleasantly the
      days when the Jay County bar was famous. The local magnate, Beekman, was
      not a lawyer; he could not make a speech; he didn&rsquo;t even look as if he
      could make a speech. He had none of the affable, taking ways which Albert
      Fairchild used to such purpose, but was brusque, self-contained, prone to
      be dogmatic when he was not taciturn. Thus the balance turned enough in
      Fairchild&rsquo;s favor to about offset Beckman&rsquo;s claims to local sympathy as a
      Jayhawker, and put Tyre people in excellent mental trim to enjoy all the
      points of the duel.
    </p>
    <p>
      For in the minds of these practical politicians, it <i>was</i> a duel.
      There was a third candidate, named Ansdell, it was true, supported by
      nearly all the Adams delegation, but then he was a reformer, and had not
      even come to the Convention, and Tyre had no use for him. A county boss
      who had got a machine, and purposed doing certain definite things with it,
      either to build up himself or crush somebody else, was natural and
      comprehensible; but a man who set himself up as a candidate, without the
      backing of any recognized political forces, who came supported by
      delegates elected in a public and lawless manner without reference to the
      wishes of leaders, and who pretended that his sole mission in politics was
      to help purify it&mdash;who <i>could</i> make head or tail out of that?
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Tyreans talked with one another, as the village began to take on an
      air of liveliness after breakfast, and groups slowly formed on the
      sidewalks in front of the two hotels. There were many shades of diverging
      opinion as to the merits and the prospects of the approaching contest, but
      on one matter of belief there was a consensus of agreement. The fight lay
      between Beekman and Fairchild, and the third man&mdash;it was interesting
      to note that ignorance of his name was fashionable&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t in the
      race. Steve Chesney, whose right to speak oracularly on politics was his
      sole inheritance from the departed Warwick, his father, summed up the
      situation very clearly from the standpoint of Tyre when he said, leaning
      comfortably against the post office hitching post, and pointing his
      arguments in the right places with accurate tobacco juice shots at a crack
      in the curb:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hull p&rsquo;int&rsquo;s this: Dearborn&rsquo;s got seventeen votes, ain&rsquo;t she?&mdash;solid
      for Fairchild. Then he&rsquo;s got two &rsquo;n&rsquo; Adams, ain&rsquo;t he?&mdash;makin&rsquo;
      nineteen &rsquo;n&rsquo; all. Th&rsquo; dude, he&rsquo;s got what&rsquo;s left of Adams, fifteen
      &rsquo;n&rsquo; all. Jay County&rsquo;s only got ten votes, ain&rsquo;t she? Very well,
      they&rsquo;re solid for Abe. <i>Now!</i> Twenty-three&rsquo;s a majority of the
      convention. Git twenty-three &rsquo;n&rsquo; that settles it. Th&rsquo; reformer, he
      needs eight votes. Kin he git &rsquo;em? Whair frum? Frum Dearborn? Not
      much! Frum Jay? Well, not <i>this</i> evening! Count him out then. Of th&rsquo;
      other two, Fairchild wants four votes, Abe needs thirteen. Thet looks kind
      o&rsquo; sickly for Abe, mebbe yeh think. But bear in mine thet th&rsquo; Adams men
      air pledged agin&rsquo; Fairchild by th&rsquo; same resolution which bines &rsquo;em
      to th&rsquo; other chap. Abe wasn&rsquo;t a candidate then &rsquo;n&rsquo; he didn&rsquo;t git
      barred out. But they made a dead set agin Fairchild all through Adams, on
      &rsquo;count of his funny work at th&rsquo; State Convention. <i>So</i>, Adams
      kin go to Abe, &rsquo;n&rsquo; she can&rsquo;t go to Fairchild. I tell yeh, Jay can&rsquo;t
      be beat, ef she&rsquo;s only a mine to think so&mdash;thet is, of course, ef
      Dearborn fights fair. Ef she don&rsquo;t, p&rsquo;raps she may win to-day, but I tell
      yeh, in thet case ther won&rsquo;t be enough left of her candidate come &rsquo;lection
      night to wad a hoss-pistol with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Jay County delegates had begun to straggle into town, and percolate
      aimlessly through the throngs in and about the bar-rooms, listening to the
      discussions, and exchanging compliments and small talk with acquaintances.
      Pending the appearance of their leader there was nothing else for them to
      do. There was a rumor that Abe Beekman was in town, sending for men as he
      wanted to see them, one by one, but nobody professed to be in the secret
      of his hiding place, and nobody dreamed of attempting to find out what Abe
      wished to keep dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Adams County men, delegates and others, came over the hill from the
      Spartacus station in a carryall, with four horses, and created a genuine
      sensation as they drew up with a great clatter and splashing of mud in
      front of the Nedahma House, and descended jauntily from the rear step to
      the curb-stone. The natives eyed them all with deep interest, for upon
      their action depended the issue of the day, but there was a special
      excitement in watching the nine delegates with stove-pipe hats and gloves,
      and tight rolled umbrellas, who came from Tecumseh itself. Tecumseh was
      the only city in the district, or the whole section, for that matter, and
      Jay County people timidly, wistfully dreamed of its gilded temptations,
      its wild revels of sumptuous gayety, its dazzling luxuriance of life, as
      shepherd boys on the plain of Dura might have dreamed of the mysteries and
      marvels of Babylon. It was something, at least, to touch elbows with men
      whose daily life was passed in Tecumseh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such of the younger Tyreans as had been introduced to these exalted
      creatures on their previous visit crowded around them now, to
      deferentially renew the acquaintance, and shine before their neighbors in
      its reflected light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the news filtered through the groups round about that Ansdell himself
      had come up this time, and was the short, wiry little man with the drab
      overcoat and the sharp black eyes. This aroused a fleeting interest, and
      there was some standing on tip-toe to get a good view of him, but it could
      not last long, for Ansdell as a politician was not a tangible thing on
      which the tendrils of Tyre&rsquo;s imagination could get a real grip.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was of more importance to learn whether the views of the Adams
      delegates had undergone any change&mdash;whether a new light had dawned
      upon them in the interim. They submitted graciously to the preliminary
      test of drinks at the bar, and pretended with easy affability to remember
      distinctly the various Tyre men who came up and recalled their
      acquaintance of a fortnight ago, but they had nothing to say that was to
      the purpose. They were waiting; they would see what turned up; they would
      certainly vote for Ansdell on the first ballot; further than that they
      couldn&rsquo;t say, but they saw no reason now why they shouldn&rsquo;t keep on voting
      for him; still, perhaps something might happen&mdash;this and nothing
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile there was an uneasy whisper going the rounds to the effect that
      the two Adams men who had previously voted for Fairchild were now for
      Ansdell, having succumbed to local pressure during the fortnight. The
      story could not be verified, for the two gentlemen in question had
      secreted themselves upon their arrival, and the other Adams men only
      grinned bland mystery when interrogated on the subject. This worried the
      Tyre men a good deal more than they would have liked to admit, but there
      was a certain element of pleasure in it, too, for it added piquancy to the
      coming fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wooden minute hand of the old clock on the court house cupola had
      laboriously twitched along to the zenith of the dial once more, marking
      ten o&rsquo;clock; only half an hour remained now before the time for the
      Convention to reassemble, and the Dearborn delegates were still absent.
      People began to stroll toward the court house, and casually attach
      themselves to the outskirts of the cluster of saturnine, clean-shaven,
      thin-featured old villagers, in high black stocks and broad-brimmed soft
      hats, who stood on the steps, behind the fluted columns of the building&rsquo;s
      ambitious Grecian front, and chewed tobacco voraciously while they set up
      the rival claims of Martin Van Buren and Francis Granger, or mumblingly
      wrangled over the life and works of De Witt Clinton. These old men, by
      reason of the antiquity and single-heartedness of their devotion to their
      country, had two inalienable and confirmed rights: to sit on the platform
      close by the speakers when the Declaration of Independence was read each
      Fourth of July and to have the first chance for seats when the doors were
      opened at a political Convention.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the eyes of those who had lingered about the Turnpike Tavern were
      gladdened by the sight of the Dearborn crowd, driving furiously up in
      three or four vehicles. Milton Squires was in the foremost wagon, and he
      was the first to alight.
    </p>
    <p>
      He trembled and turned around swiftly as a man laid a hand on his
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What d&rsquo;yeh want?&rdquo; he demanded, with nervous alertness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man whispered in his ear: &ldquo;Abe Beekman is over in the back settin&rsquo;
      room at Blodgett&rsquo;s, &rsquo;n&rsquo; he wants to see your man Fairchile right
      off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Milton had regained his composure. &ldquo;So do I want to see him. Whair abaouts
      is he? I was to meet him here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t been no sign of him here, this mornin&rsquo;. Nobuddy &rsquo;n
      Tyre&rsquo;s laid eyes on him, so far&rsquo;s I kin fine aout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thet&rsquo;s cur&rsquo;ous,&rdquo; said Milton reflectively. &ldquo;He started to drive over
      early enough. We cum by train, expectin&rsquo; to fine him here. P&rsquo;raps he&rsquo;s
      seen Beekman by this time, on th&rsquo; quiet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo; The messenger&rsquo;s tone was highly positive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then mebbe I&rsquo;d better go &rsquo;n&rsquo; see Beekman myself. Whair is
      Blodgett&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man led the way off the main street, to a big, clap-boarded, dingy
      white house, fronting nowhere in particular, and stopped at the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you comin&rsquo; in?&rdquo; Milton asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dasen&rsquo;t.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV.&mdash;THE CONVENTION: THE NEWS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>here were two
      strange men in the low-ceilinged, grimly-furnished &ldquo;settin&rsquo; room,&rdquo; as
      Milton was ushered into the presence of the Boss, but at a gesture from
      this magnate they went out; the Boss surveyed the new comer without a word
      of greeting or comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beekman was a tall, angular man, past the prime of life, as was shown
      by the gray in his thick hair, curling at the ends, and in the stiff,
      projecting ruff of beard under his chin. His face was thin, hungry, with a
      plaintive effect of deep lines, and his great blue-black eyes were often
      tearful, like a young robin&rsquo;s, in their intent watchfulness. He was almost
      wholly Dutch in parentage&mdash;of that silent, persistent,
      quietly-masterful race which, despite all the odds, has still held more
      than its own in Stuyvesant&rsquo;s State&mdash;and the descent showed itself in
      the dusky hue of his skin. He had never been a wealthy man, though he came
      of a family decently supplied with substance, and of long settlement in
      the county. He had climbed to his present eminence after a long career in
      local politics, by that process of exhaustion which we call the survival
      of the fittest. Having attained it, his rule was that of a just despot,
      rewarding and binding still more closely to him the faithful,
      remorselessly crushing all signs of rivalry, and putting the recalcitrant
      without pity to fire and sword. He had an almost supernatural faculty of
      organizing information, and getting at the motives of men. He sniffed
      treachery as a deer in the breeze sniffs the dog, and he had an oriental
      way of striking with cruel swiftness, before anybody but the guilty victim
      suspected offence. Withal, he was a kindly man to those who deserved well
      of him, an upright citizen according to his lights, and a profound
      believer in his party.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat now chewing an unlighted cigar, with his feet on the hearth of the
      stove, and contemplated Milton at his leisure. He did not like Milton at
      all, and one of his chief reasons for doubting the real ability of Albert
      Fairchild was his choice of such an agent and confidant. At last he said,
      curtly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you, is it? I&rsquo;ve got no business with you! Where&rsquo;s Fairchild?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something in Beekman&rsquo;s eager, searching way of looking at a man
      with those big bright eyes of his which, coupled with the question,
      embarrassed Milton, and he fumbled with his hat as he repeated the
      explanation he had given to the messenger. He was annoyed with himself for
      being thus disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Boss looked his visitor out of countenance once more. Then he said:
      &ldquo;Sit daown! Well, what is it to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Milton grinned, and leaned forward familiarly in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sh&rsquo;d ruther think that was fur you to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you think so, do yeh? You imagine you&rsquo;ve got me on the hip, ay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, p&rsquo;raps we&rsquo;re no jedge, but it sorts o&rsquo; looks that way, now, don&rsquo;t
      it?&rdquo; Milton tipped back his chair, satisfiedly, and put one of his big
      feet up on the hearth, to dispute possession with the Boss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beekman reflected for a minute: then he began, after glancing at the
      clock:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no time to waste. I might as well talk up &rsquo;n&rsquo; daown with
      yeh. Your man Fairchild makes me tired. Ef he&rsquo;d set his heart on goin&rsquo; to
      Congress, why on airth didn&rsquo;t he come to me in the first place, &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      say so? It could &rsquo;a&rsquo; been arranged, easy&rsquo;s slidin&rsquo; off a log. But
      no, instid of that, he must go &rsquo;n&rsquo; work up th&rsquo; thing his own way,
      &rsquo;n&rsquo; then come &rsquo;n&rsquo; buck agin me in my own caounty, &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      obleege me to fight back. D&rsquo;yeh call that sense? He&rsquo;s smart enough in his
      way, I grant yeh. He&rsquo;s fixed up a putty fair sort o&rsquo; organisation in
      Dearborn, although it can&rsquo;t last long, simply because it&rsquo;s all built up on
      money, &rsquo;n&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t go a cent on that kind of organising. Still it&rsquo;s
      good enough in its way. <i>But</i>, he made his mistake in lettin&rsquo; the
      idea run away with him that he could skeer me into a conniption fit with
      his musharoon organisation. He didn&rsquo;t knaow me. He never took the trouble
      to find aout abaout me. He jest took it fur granted that I&rsquo;d crawl daown
      aout o&rsquo; my tree, like Davy Crockett&rsquo;s coon, as soon&rsquo;s he pinted his gun at
      me. Well, I didn&rsquo;t come worth a cent. Then, when he faound aout that he&rsquo;d
      struck a snag, &rsquo;n&rsquo; that Dearborn County wasn&rsquo;t the hull deestrick,
      he turns raoun&rsquo; &rsquo;n&rsquo; aouts with his wallet, &rsquo;n&rsquo; tries to hire
      me to come daown. Fur that&rsquo;s what you was here for last week, &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      you knaow it&rsquo;s well&rsquo;s I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Milton tried to get in some words here, of dissent or explanation, but the
      Boss would not hear them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lem me go on; &rsquo;s no use your lyin&rsquo;. That was Fairchild&rsquo;s second
      mistake. He thought politics was all money. Ef I was poorer than Job&rsquo;s
      turkey, he couldn&rsquo;t buy me to so much as wink an eye fur him. I&rsquo;m not in
      politics fur what I kin make aout of it. I&rsquo;m in because I like it; because
      it&rsquo;s meat &rsquo;n&rsquo; drink to me; because I git solid, substantial comfort
      aout of it. Ther&rsquo;s satisfaction in carryin&rsquo; yer eend; there&rsquo;s pretty nigh
      as much in daownin&rsquo; them that&rsquo;s agin yeh. Jest naow I&rsquo;m a thinkin&rsquo; a good
      deal what fun it &rsquo;d be to let the floor aout from under your man
      altogether, &rsquo;n&rsquo; nominate this feller from Tecumsy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; broke in Milton, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a candidate yer-self, &rsquo;n&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till I&rsquo;m threw, will yeh? I <i>said</i>, I&rsquo;m leanin&rsquo; a good deal
      jest naow to&rsquo;rd this man from Tecumsy. I c&rsquo;d beat him easy &rsquo;nough
      at the polls, ef he turned cranky, but I daoubt ef it &rsquo;d be wuth
      while. I ain&rsquo;t seen him yet, but I&rsquo;m told he&rsquo;s here, &rsquo;n&rsquo; ef I like
      his looks durn me ef I ain&rsquo;t a mine to nominate him. He can&rsquo;t do no harm,
      even ef he tries. These reform spurts don&rsquo;t winter well. They never last
      till spring. The boys lose their breath for a few months. But then they
      git daown to work agin, and baounce the reformers to the back seats where
      they belong. But it &rsquo;d be one thing to elect a high-toned,
      kid-gloved, butter-wouldn&rsquo;t-melt-in-his-maouth kind o&rsquo; man like
      what&rsquo;s-his-name, &rsquo;n&rsquo; a hoss o&rsquo; quite another color to &rsquo;lect
      Fairchild. <i>He&rsquo;d</i> make me trouble from the word &lsquo;go!&rsquo; Understan&rsquo;, I
      ain&rsquo;t afraid of his meddlin&rsquo; with me here in Jay caounty; not a bit of it.
      But he&rsquo;d use his position to cripple me in the deestrick. The present
      Congressman tried that on&mdash; &rsquo;n&rsquo; you ain&rsquo;t so much as heerd his
      name mentioned fur a re-nomination. But it was bother &rsquo;nough to
      squelch him. I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to hev it to do all over agin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right you air, tew!&rdquo; Milton responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Boss held up his hand to forbid further interruption, while he looked
      curiously at his visitor, as if puzzled by his acquiescence. He went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ef you was a man of any readin&rsquo; you&rsquo;d hev heerd of a custom among
      Europe-ian kentries, when one whips another, of makin&rsquo; the under dog in
      the fight pull aout his front teeth, like. The beaten kentry has to tear
      daown its forts, &rsquo;n&rsquo; blow up its men-o&rsquo;-war, &rsquo;n&rsquo; so on, jest
      as a guarantee not to make any more trouble. Well, ef I&rsquo;d concluded to hev
      any dealin&rsquo;s at all with Fairchild, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d hev done with him. I&rsquo;d
      &rsquo;a&rsquo; made him turn over the appintment of all Dearborn&rsquo;s men on the
      deestrick Committee; &rsquo;n&rsquo; I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a had a written agreement that
      half the Postmasters in Adams &rsquo;n&rsquo; Dearborn, as well as all in Jay,
      should be o&rsquo; my namin&rsquo;. My wife&rsquo;s brother should hev hed the Thessaly post
      office, tew, right under Fairchild&rsquo;s nose, so&rsquo;s to keep an eye on him.
      It&rsquo;s the duty of every man to purvide for his own fam&rsquo;ly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; small about <i>you!</i> You only wanted the hull airth!&rdquo; chuckled
      Milton, ingratiatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it was Fairchild who wanted the airth &rsquo;n&rsquo; thought he&rsquo;d got it,
      &rsquo;n&rsquo; while he was deliberatin&rsquo; whether he&rsquo;d have it braowned on both
      sides or not, lo &rsquo;n&rsquo; behold I went in &rsquo;n&rsquo; took it away from
      him slick &rsquo;n&rsquo; clean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Boss rose as he was speaking, reached for his overcoat and put it on.
      &ldquo;Time&rsquo;s up!&rdquo; he said, sententiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milton had risen too, and placed himself between Beekman and the door.
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s seven minutes yit,&rdquo; he said eagerly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got something yeh
      can&rsquo;t afford to miss. Don&rsquo;t you want th&rsquo; nomination yer-self?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. What good&rsquo;d Washington be to me? New York State&rsquo;s big enough for me.
      If yeh don&rsquo;t understand that I put my name before the Convention jest to
      hold my caounty together, &rsquo;n&rsquo; block Dearborn, yer a dummed sight
      bigger fool than even I took yeh to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But s&rsquo;pose Dearborn&rsquo;s votes cud be thrown to you! They&rsquo;d nominate yeh!
      What&rsquo;d thet be wuth to yeh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What &rsquo;d it be wuth?&rdquo; mused the Boss, looking intently at Milton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! in ready money, here! naow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Boss took up his hat, meditatively, and gazed at his companion again.
      &ldquo;Did you knaow th&rsquo; man that brought yeh here?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;&rsquo;twas Jim Bunner, wa&rsquo;nt it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That man &rsquo;d wade threw fire &rsquo;n&rsquo; water fer me. Yeh couldn&rsquo;t
      tempt him with a hundred thaousan&rsquo; dollars to so much as say an evil word
      abaout me, let alone injure me. Yit he&rsquo;s desprit poor, &rsquo;n&rsquo; th&rsquo; unly
      thing I ever did fer him in my life, excep&rsquo; givin&rsquo; him a day&rsquo;s work naow
      &rsquo;n&rsquo; then, was to help him bury his child decently, ten years ago.
      But <i>I</i> know my <i>men!</i> Here Fairchild has took you off a
      dunghill, where all yer hull humly, sore-eyed, misrubble fam&rsquo;ly belong, &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      made a man of yeh, trusted his affairs to yeh, clothed yeh, fed yeh, yes,
      &rsquo;n&rsquo; let yeh fatten yerself on the profits of his farm&mdash;and
      naow yeh turn &rsquo;raound &rsquo;n&rsquo; offer to sell him aout. By gum! I
      was right. Fairchild hain&rsquo;t got no sense! &rsquo;N&rsquo; you, yeh skunk, git
      aout! Don&rsquo;t yeh walk on the same side of the street with me, or I&rsquo;ll swat
      the hull top of yer head off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll nominate Ansdell &rsquo;fore you git a chance!&rdquo; snarled Milton.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The Convention met, depressed by the evident feeling of disappointment
      among the spectators, who swarmed on all the high, pewlike seats back of
      the bar railing, while the delegates sat in rows of chairs inside the
      space reserved in term time for the lawyers. There was ground enough for
      this disappointment. Fairchild had not come, and the prospects of a good
      speech, or even a bitter personal contest, were fading away. No one had an
      explanation for his absence. The Dearborn delegates were more in the dark
      than outsiders even, for they had been told to meet him in Tyre, before
      the Convention, and that he would breakfast at the Turnpike Tavern. Milton
      reassured them for a time by enlarging upon the bad condition of the
      roads, but even he ended as they took their seats, by professing some fear
      of an accident. &ldquo;However, I&rsquo;ll cast th&rsquo; solid vaote, th&rsquo; same as before, I
      suppose?&rdquo; he said, and the bondsmen nodded assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proceedings opened tamely. The Chairman was a professor from the
      Tecumseh Academy; the other counties each had a secretary. Two written
      announcements were handed up to be read, one that Milton Squires was
      authorized to cast seventeen votes for Dearborn County, the other naming a
      man to perform a similar function for the ten votes of Jay. There was to
      be no break yet awhile, apparently, in the two machine counties. But&mdash;what
      would Adams do?
    </p>
    <p>
      As this question flashed through the minds of the assemblage, one of the
      Adams delegates rose, walked to the bench, gave a paper to the presiding
      officer, and then joined the little throng of spectators to one side. Did
      this mean that he left the Convention? What <i>did</i> it mean?
      Experienced observers began to feel that something startling was coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      The paper being read, turned out to be an announcement that Abram K.
      Beekman had been substituted in the Adams County delegation for the
      delegate who had just vacated his seat, and as the words died away the
      Boss himself pushed his way down the aisle, threw his long leg over the
      bar-rail, and took his seat. The master of Jay County getting substituted
      for Adams County&mdash;here <i>was</i> a mystery! Did it portend that
      Adams had been won for Beekman&rsquo;s candidature? Yes, it must mean that&mdash;and
      Tyre&rsquo;s heart leapt for joy. Or no&mdash;it couldn&rsquo;t mean that. The Boss
      would hardly thrust himself forward in that brash way if he were sure of
      winning&mdash;and Tyre&rsquo;s heart sank again, sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chairman announced that balloting would be resumed; that the counties
      would be called in alphabetical order, and that, in the case of Adams
      County, which did not signify a desire to vote as a unit, the names of the
      delegates would also be called in that order. Before the words were fairly
      out of his mouth a hundred shrewd brains had discovered that this meant
      Beekman&rsquo;s being the first name called. But what was his game?
    </p>
    <p>
      So perplexed were the men of Tyre with this problem that they almost
      forgot to cheer when their man rose to his feet, in response to his name.
      It was rarely that one saw Abe Beekman in Conventions; he preferred to run
      them from the outside; and no one in the hall had ever heard him make a
      speech. Imagine how they listened now!
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with an almost boyish nervousness, resting his hands on the table
      before him, and clinging, as it were, with his eyes to the Chairman for
      support. What he said was brief, to the point, and worth repeating here:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got substituted, ez p&rsquo;raps some of yeh hev guessed, because I wanted a
      word at the very start. I hev my reasons. I ain&rsquo;t a&rsquo; goin&rsquo; to mention no
      names&mdash;&rdquo; he darted a swift, significant glance over toward the
      Dearborn County men, singling out Milton for a second, then reverting his
      troubled gaze to the Chairman&mdash;&ldquo;but I kin feel it in my bones that
      things ain&rsquo;t on the square here. Ther&rsquo;s a nigger in the fence. Mebbe it&rsquo;s
      no business of mine to yank him aout, but it&rsquo;s only fair to my caounty
      that we shouldn&rsquo;t let anybody git ahead of us in doin&rsquo; what we want to
      dew. It&rsquo;s trew that D. comes ahead o&rsquo; J. in the alph&rsquo;bet, but&rdquo;&mdash;and
      there was a momentary relaxation of his eager, sombre face as he
      enunciated this undoubted fact&mdash;&ldquo;its jest as trew that A. comes in
      front o&rsquo; D. Ef any set o&rsquo; men&mdash;mind, I mention no names, but&mdash;ef
      any set o&rsquo; delegates come here with the idee o&rsquo; sellin&rsquo; their man aout, or
      o&rsquo; makin&rsquo; a combination which&rsquo;ll put them solid with the next Congressman,
      and leave Jay aout in the cold, perhaps &rsquo;fore I&rsquo;m threw they&rsquo;ll see
      thet they bit off more&rsquo;n their jaws could wag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Cheerman, I don&rsquo;t want to go to Congress. I never &rsquo;v&rsquo; hed the
      least hankerin&rsquo; after it. This State of aours is good enough for me. I
      wouldn&rsquo;t feel like myself ef I had to stan&rsquo; &rsquo;raoun&rsquo; &rsquo;n&rsquo; see
      chaps from Rhode Island or Floridy puttin&rsquo; on airs, and pretendin&rsquo; to cut
      as big a swath as New York did. I&rsquo;m too much of a State man fer thet. I&rsquo;d
      be itchin&rsquo; to jump on &rsquo;em all the while. So I want to say that I
      withdraw my name&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Hon. Elhanan Pratt rose here, his weazen little figure coming up with
      a spring like a jack-in-the-box, and squeaked out sharply: &ldquo;I rise to a
      point of order. The Abram K. Beekman whose name is before this Convention
      is a Jay County man, nominated by Jay County, and voted for alone by Jay
      County. No Adams County man&rdquo;&mdash;there was an elaborate sarcasm in the
      tone&mdash;&ldquo;has any right to withdraw that name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The point of order is well taken,&rdquo; said the Chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in thet case I won&rsquo;t ask to withdraw my name,&rdquo; responded Beekman.
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll make much differ&rsquo;nce. A wink is as good as a nod
      to a bline man. P&rsquo;raps you kin git an idee by this time haow the Jay
      caounty cat&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to jump; p&rsquo;raps you can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m-goin&rsquo; to vaote fer Mr.
      Richard Ansdell, &rsquo;n&rsquo; I wan&rsquo; to say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was interrupted here by a stout, sharp burst of hand-clapping from the
      Adams delegates, and the few Adams men in the audience. The Tyre crowd
      were taken aback for an instant, and sat bewildered; then the fact that
      their man had played his game, and was acting as if he had won, inspired
      them to join tumultuously in the applause, though they were in total
      darkness as to the nature of the stakes played for.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Boss went on: &ldquo;I wan&rsquo; to say that I&rsquo;ve never laid eyes on him but
      once, &rsquo;n&rsquo; never spoke a word with him in my life. But I ain&rsquo;t lived
      all this while &rsquo;thaout learnin&rsquo; to read somethin&rsquo; of a man&rsquo;s natur&rsquo;
      in his face. I believe he&rsquo;s honest and straight-aout; I don&rsquo;t believe
      there&rsquo;s a crookid hair in his head. P&rsquo;raps he&rsquo;s got some naotions that
      we&rsquo;d look on as finnickin&rsquo; up here in Jay, but I ain&rsquo;t afeard o&rsquo; them.
      It&rsquo;s better to hev a man standin&rsquo; so upright thet he bends back&rsquo;rd, then
      to hev&mdash;&mdash; to hev&mdash;&mdash; the fact is, Mr. Cheerman, <i>I</i>
      think I&rsquo;ve said &rsquo;baout enough. Th&rsquo; other candidate hain&rsquo;t showed up
      today! P&rsquo;raps it&rsquo;s jest as well fur him that he hain&rsquo;t. I guess he&rsquo;ll
      consider that he&rsquo;s got abaout threw with deestrick politics&mdash;but I
      don&rsquo;t want to appear to be rubbin&rsquo; it in. The lawyers hev a Latin sayin&rsquo;
      abaout speakin&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; but good o&rsquo; the dead&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beekman stopped short. The Chairman had risen to his feet. Half the
      delegates had followed his example, and were gazing intently at one of the
      tall, small-paned windows on the right side of the room. The three
      reporters who were sitting in the clerk&rsquo;s desk had begun climbing over the
      rails and weaving their way between the chairs toward this same window. A
      hum of rising murmurs was running through the audience. Beekman, finding
      suddenly that he had no auditors, and disconcerted at the interruption,
      looked about the room for a moment, in search of an explanation. Then he
      followed the direction of the faces, and saw his retainer, Jim Bunner,
      clambering in under the lifted sash, and making strenuous, almost frantic,
      efforts meanwhile to attract his attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man was breathless with excitement. He had climbed to the window from
      the roof of a low adjoining shed, and he could be heard now, as he found a
      footing on the back of a bench, in panting explanation of his conduct: &ldquo;I
      <i>hed</i> to come this way! It&rsquo;d &rsquo;a taken me tew long to&rsquo;ve got
      threw the crowd at th&rsquo; door. I&rsquo;ve got news for th&rsquo; Boss that won&rsquo;t keep a
      second!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had pushed his way roughly through the throng now, brushing the
      reporters aside with especial impatience, and stood whispering, gasping
      his tidings in Beekman&rsquo;s ear. The assemblage, silent now as the midnight
      watch, read in the deepening shadows and shocked severity of the Boss&rsquo;s
      face that something far out of the ordinary had happened. Beekman appeared
      to be asking some questions, and pondering the whispered answers with
      increasing emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiting hundreds, all on their feet now, watched him in a tremor of
      expectation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he spoke, in a low, changed, yet extremely distinct voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Cheerman, when I spoke abaout sayin&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; but good o&rsquo; th&rsquo; dead, I
      spoke unbeknaown to myself like a prophet. My friend here brings some
      awful news. Mr. Fairchild o&rsquo; Dearborn has jest been faound, stark &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      cold, crunched under his hosses &rsquo;n&rsquo; carriage, at the bottom of
      Tallman&rsquo;s ravine!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXV.&mdash;&ldquo;YOU THOUGHT I DID IT!&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN Seth awoke
      next morning, the position of the shadow cast by the thick green-paper
      curtain which covered the upper half of his window, told his practised
      faculties that it was very late, and impelled him to get out of bed,
      before he began at all to remember the several momentous events of the
      previous evening. As he dressed he strove to get these arranged in their
      proper order in his mind. Curiously enough there were certain inchoate
      recollections of feminine screams, of bursts of hysterical sobbing, of low
      but rough and strange male voices, doleful and haunting, which confusedly
      struggled for place in his sleepy thoughts, and seemed now to be a part of
      the evening&rsquo;s occurrences, now to belong to this present morning, and to
      have come to him while he was nearing the end of his sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he passed his Aunt Sabrina&rsquo;s door on his way to the stairs, he heard
      from within this same sound of suppressed weeping. This much at least of
      the unlocated recollections must have belonged to the first stages of his
      waking. &ldquo;Another quarrel with Isabel!&rdquo; he thought, as he descended the
      stairs. &ldquo;Why is it that women must always be rowing it with each other!&rdquo;
       Then his own dispute with Albert came fresh and overpowering in
      distinctness of impression across his mind, and the grounds of his
      grievance against the temper of the other sex faded away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The living-room was vacant&mdash;the breakfast table still standing in the
      disorder of a meal just finished, and the shades down as though the day
      had not yet begun, although the clock showed it to be past ten. One of the
      folding doors of the parlor was open and he heard Isabel&rsquo;s voice&mdash;it
      struck him as being strangely altered toward harshness of fibre&mdash;calling
      him to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood, as he remembered her once before, in front of the piano. In the
      dusk of the drawn curtains&mdash;how gloomy and distrait everything about
      the house was this morning!&mdash;her figure was not very clearly visible,
      but her face was so pale that it seemed to be independent of any light.
      Her eyes had the effect of slight distention, and, in the shadow, were
      singularly dark of tint. They were gazing at him with a strange, intent,
      troubled look, and the expression of the pallid face went with this to
      disturb him vaguely. He said to himself, in the moment of waiting for her
      to speak, that he must keep his troth with Annie resolutely in mind, and,
      if needs be, not shrink from avowing and standing by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isabel did not offer him her hand, or tender him any greeting whatever;
      only looked him through and through with that searching, unaccustomed
      gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t let them call you,&rdquo; she said at last, speaking slowly, as if
      with an effort to both form these words, and repress others. &ldquo;I knew that
      you needed the sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry if I put anybody out by my laziness. But it is such a relief
      to be able to sleep like that once in a while, instead of having to get
      down to the office by eight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard you go out last night. I heard you come in this morning. But not
      another soul in the house suspects that you were out; not one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone was unmistakably solemn, and weighted with deep feeling of some
      sort. Seth uneasily felt that a scene was impending, though he could not
      foresee its form. He felt, too, that the part he must play in it would of
      necessity be an awkward one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;the night seemed too fine to stay in doors. Besides,
      I was nervous, and it did me good to walk it off. You can&rsquo;t imagine how
      light-hearted I was when I returned, or&mdash;for that matter&mdash;how
      heavy-hearted when I went out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word came forth like the red flash from clouds which can no longer
      retain their pent-up, warring, swelling forces&mdash;an interjection of
      passion, of dread, of infinite troubling, of doubt wreathed in struggle
      with pain. She swayed slightly toward him, her hands clasped and stretched
      down and forward with a gesture of excessive perturbation, her great eyes
      lustrous with the excitement of this battle of emotions. Seth fancied that
      the dominant meaning of the look was reproach. He could not in the least
      see his way through the dilemma, or even understand it. He could only say
      to himself that the enchantment was ended, and that, come what might, he
      would not forget Annie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman glided a step nearer to him. She put one hand to her brow with a
      sudden movement, and rested the other upon the piano, as if all at once
      conscious of needing support. With a painful little laugh, hysterically
      incongruous, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am almost beside myself, am I not? I can not speak to you, it seems!
      And yet there is so much to say&mdash;or no! isn&rsquo;t silence better still?&rdquo;
       Her voice trembled as she went on: &ldquo;For what <i>could</i> we say? How
      meaningless all our words would be in the face of&mdash;&mdash; of&mdash;&mdash;-.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She swept both hands to her eyes, with an impetuous gesture. Her form
      seemed to totter for a moment, so that Seth instinctively moved toward
      her. Then with a wild outburst of sobs she threw herself upon his breast,
      convulsed with incessant paroxysms of passionate weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood thus together for some minutes. The young man, moved to great
      tenderness by her evident suffering, the cause of which he vaguely
      referred to the previous evening&rsquo;s events, put his arm about her,
      whispered gently to her to be comforted, and stroked her hair with a soft,
      caressing touch. His hand touched her cheek, and she shuddered at the
      contact; then swiftly took the hand in hers, and raised it to her lips,
      murmuring between the sobs:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ungrateful! was it not done for me? Ah, dear, I shall not shudder again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She kissed the hand repeatedly, and pressed it to her bosom, as she spoke.
      She was still trembling like a leaf in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could it all mean? he asked himself&mdash;and found no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must be brave, dear,&rdquo; she whispered now. &ldquo;We must be on our guard
      every instant! Oh&mdash;h! they shall tear my heart out before they learn
      anything&mdash;so much as a syllable! We must keep our nerves.&rdquo; She looked
      up into his astonished face, with almost a smile in her effort to
      strengthen his courage. &ldquo;We <i>will</i> be brave, won&rsquo;t we, mine? The test
      will come soon now. Perhaps in an hour they will bring&mdash;<i>it!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The trembling seized her frame, and shook it with cruel force. She buried
      her face in his breast with along, low cry of anguish, and sobbed there
      piteously, clinging to his hand still. Once she bent as if to kiss it
      again, but stopped, then turned her head aside, groaning &ldquo;Oh how terrible!
      how terrible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mystification now demanded light of some sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it that is so terrible, my poor girl?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;What are they
      going to bring in an hour? Tell me, Isabel&mdash;my sweet sister&mdash;what
      does it all mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up into his face, with flickering suggestions of a mechanical
      smile at the comers of her pale lips, and with soft reproach in her eyes:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to pretend to <i>me</i>, too, dear one? As if it were not
      all here in my heart&mdash;all, all! Ah, they shan&rsquo;t get it! They shan&rsquo;t
      get the shadow of a hint. You were home here all the while! You were
      asleep, sound asleep! If it be necessary, I could swear that I <i>knew</i>
      you were asleep, that&mdash;but no, there might be suspicion then. That we
      mustn&rsquo;t have! Don&rsquo;t fear for me, dear one! I shall be so discreet, so
      circumspect, watching, weighing every word! But oh&mdash;h&mdash;shall we
      dream of <i>it?</i> What if we should, and should cry out in our sleep&mdash;Oh-h,
      my God! my God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sank again, convulsively clutching his hand, and quivering with
      feverish sobs upon his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my soul, I don&rsquo;t in the least know what you are talking about,
      Isabel! Do try and be calm, and tell me what it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>He</i> asks <i>me!</i>&rdquo; she cried, with the same jarring, painful
      half-laugh he had heard before.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held her from him, so that he might look into her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come! You are acting like a tragedy-queen on the stage. Do be
      sensible, and tell me what the matter is. You make me out of patience with
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke in the vexed tone of a man needlessly perplexed with foolish
      mysteries. To her strained senses the simple expression of impatience was
      cruel mockery. She drew herself still further back from him, and dropped
      his hand. She was able to speak collectedly now:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is <i>you</i> who are the actor. You persist in playing the part&mdash;to
      <i>me!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still in riddles! <i>What</i> part, Isabel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>will</i> have me tell you? You want to hear the thing&mdash;in
      words?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, by all means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had never once taken her frightened, fascinated gaze from his face.
      &ldquo;You insist on hearing from my lips that while you were out last night
      your brother was murdered&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Murdered not four miles from here, as he was driving on the road, and his
      body thrown down into a ravine. Some boys found it. Fortunately, everybody
      thinks it was an accident. The men who brought the news thought so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had spoken the words coldly, as if they were commonplaces and had been
      learnt by rote; but all the passion of her being was flaming in her eyes,
      which transfixed him with their stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mur-dered!&rdquo; the young man stammered, feeling his senses reeling. &ldquo;Albert
      murdered! Oh-h this must be nonsense! It is too terrible to think of even!
      You are out of your mind, Isabel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her lips quivered: &ldquo;It would be no wonder if I were, after <i>this!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The darkened rooms, the sobbing of his Aunt upstairs, the sounds of
      anguish that he knew now had partially awakened him, the crazed demeanor
      of Isabel&mdash;all these rose around him, like a black fog, to choke and
      confound his mind. Her fixed gaze burned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what you know!&rdquo; he cried, wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be easier to tell me what <i>you</i> know?&rdquo; The chilling tone
      of the words startled him, as might a sudden contact of warm flesh with
      ice, before his bewildered brain had grasped their meaning. Then, like the
      crimson, all-pervading outburst of a conflagration, the thing dawned upon
      him, and his thoughts seemed blood-red in its hideous light. He pushed her
      from him fiercely, returning her piteous look of fright with a glare, and
      biting his tongue for words that should be great enough to fairly
      overwhelm her. As she cowered, he strode toward her: &ldquo;You thought I did
      it!&rdquo; he shouted at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her only answer was to bury her face in her hands, and sink weakly at his
      knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood relentlessly glowering down upon her. The bitter, brutal words
      that might be heaped upon her, nay, that ought to be, crowded upon his
      tongue. It was too great a task to restrain them, to keep silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> thought <i>I</i> did it,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;And you didn&rsquo;t object&mdash;you
      didn&rsquo;t shrink from me! Why, I remember&mdash;my God!&mdash;you kissed my
      hand! You said: &lsquo;it was done for me! &rsquo; Oh-h!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman at his feet, her face hidden, had been sobbing violently. She
      lifted her eyes now, and strove appealingly to conquer him with their
      power. She rose, unaided, to her feet, and confronted him. Terror and
      tenderness visibly struggled for the mastery of her facial expression, as
      for the mood behind it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Seth, don&rsquo;t! Can&rsquo;t you see how I am suffering? Have you no pity?
      How <i>can</i> you have the heart to speak to me like this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> talk about pity&mdash;about hearts!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long ago was it that they were on your tongue&mdash;that you had your
      arms stretched open for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t recall it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were to die this day, this hour, it would be the one thing I should
      want to remember, the one thing of my life that I should hug to my heart.
      What is changed since then? A man dead?&mdash;a man dies every minute of
      the day somewhere in the world! Suppose I was wrong! Suppose it <i>was</i>
      an accident&mdash;yes, we&rsquo;ll say it was! <i>Don&rsquo;t</i> you see&mdash;how
      little that is, how unimportant, compared with&mdash;with&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She finished the sentence by a faltering step toward him, her arms
      outstretched, her lips parted, her form offering itself for his embrace
      with a sinuous seduction of moving outlines.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old witchery flamed up for a second in his pulses; then it was
      emberless ashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a word he turned and left her.

      Aunt Sabrina opened the door of her room in response to his strenuous
      rapping, and wiped her tear-stained face with the end of her
      shoulder-shawl as her nephew entered. At his behest, she told all the
      tidings that had come to the farm. Its master had been found at the bottom
      of Tallman&rsquo;s ravine, by some boys who had climbed down to see if the
      beech-nuts were turning. The whole equipage had pitched off the narrow
      road which crossed the gulf at this point, high above. The buggy was
      smashed. One of the horses was dead; the other had two of its legs broken.
      Half hidden under the carriage and one of the beasts was Albert, quite
      lifeless and cold. The men who brought the news believed every bone in his
      body must have been broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she concluded the bare recital of facts, the poor old maid began her
      sobbing afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might uv knaowd it&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; come to this,&rdquo; she groaned; &ldquo;&lsquo;pride
      goeth before a fall,&rsquo; ez Solomon says. I hed my heart tew much sot on his
      goin&rsquo; to Congress; I was exaltin&rsquo; my horn tew high. I was settin&rsquo; by the
      window, that very minute, watchin&rsquo; Sarah Andrews go by perked up in their
      democrat wagon, with her injy shawl &rsquo;n all her fine feathers on, &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      never so much&rsquo;s turnin&rsquo; her head this way, &rsquo;n&rsquo; I was sayin&rsquo; to
      myself, &lsquo;M&rsquo; lady, you&rsquo;ll come daown a peg &rsquo;r two off &rsquo;n your
      high hoss when Albert goes to Congress&rsquo;&mdash;&rsquo;n&rsquo; there the men was
      comin&rsquo; in the gate, thet identical minute, with the news. I tell you!&rdquo; she
      roused herself into indignant declamation here, &ldquo;men like Zeke Tallman
      ought to be hung, who &rsquo;re tew shiftless or penurious to fix up
      their fences on pieces o&rsquo; raoad like thet, sao&rsquo;s to keep folks from
      drivin&rsquo; off in the dark, &rsquo;n&rsquo; killin&rsquo; themselves! That&rsquo;s what they
      ought!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it wasn&rsquo;t dark, Aunt Sabrina,&rdquo; said Seth; &ldquo;the moon was so bright all
      last night, you could have seen to read by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old lady was too occupied with her own thoughts to even think of
      inquiring as to her nephew&rsquo;s source of information. She only rocked to and
      fro, desolately, and said, as if talking to herself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sao much the wuss, Seth. It <i>was</i> to be! Nothin&rsquo; could a&rsquo; stopped
      it. Thet old witch, M&rsquo;tildy Warren, is right. There&rsquo;s a cuss on aour
      fam&rsquo;ly. Here, almost inside tew years, Sissly&rsquo;s gone, &rsquo;n&rsquo; Lemuel&rsquo;s
      gone, &rsquo;n&rsquo; naow its poor Albert! &rsquo;N&rsquo; he was gittin&rsquo; so like
      his grandfather, the Senator, tew, gittin&rsquo; to look like him, &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      ack like him; I kin remember my father&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth had left the room, with soft footsteps. He would go at once to the
      scene of his brother&rsquo;s death.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the outside door, as he opened it, he stood face to face with Annie.
      She gave him her hand silently. Her face was paler than he had ever seen
      it before, and she looked on the ground, after the first little start of
      surprise at the meeting, instead of into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have heard?&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Isn&rsquo;t it awful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you go upstairs and see Aunt Sabrina? She is in her room. I think
      the sight of you would do her good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. What a terrible shock it must be to her. And&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The widow? You&rsquo;ll find her in the parlor. Strange enough, she was weeping
      her eyes out when I last saw her.&rdquo; He could not keep the bitterness out of
      his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor woman!&rdquo; was all that Annie could find it in her heart to murmur, as
      Seth passed her on his gloomy errand, and she entered the house of
      mourning.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI.&mdash;THE CORONER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HERE was a short
      cut by which, using a rough back road across the hill, and then a
      dimly-marked bridle path down the bed of the creek, one could get to
      Tallman&rsquo;s ravine in less than an hour on foot. Seth saddled the black
      mare, and brought her up on the meadow plateau overlooking the gulf,
      panting and white on breast and barrel with foam, inside fifteen minutes.
      He had galloped furiously, unable to think save in impatient flashes, and
      reckless alike of his own neck and the beast&rsquo;s wind and limbs. He reined
      up the plunging mare at the very edge of the ravine, where some score of
      farmers and boys were standing clustered under the trees, watching his
      excited approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he threw himself from the saddle among them, and looked swiftly from
      face to face for the right one to speak to first, the attention of the
      elder bystanders concentrated itself upon the mare. They would have given
      their foremost thoughts to her anyway, for they were owners of livestock
      even before they were neighbors, and her splashed and heated condition
      appealed in protest to their deepest feeling&mdash;reverential care for
      good horseflesh. But there was something more: the mare was strangely,
      visibly agitated at the sight of the glen before her, and reared back with
      outstretched trembling forelegs, lifted ears, and distended, frightened
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Cracky!&rdquo; cried Zeke Tallman himself, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t it beat natur&rsquo;! This &rsquo;ere
      mare knaows what&rsquo;s happened! Look at her! She senses what&rsquo;s layin&rsquo; down
      there at the bottom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;N&rsquo; it they say dawgs has got more instinck than a hoss!&rdquo; said a
      younger yokel. He kicked a mongrel pup which was lounging around among the
      men&rsquo;s legs, with a fierce &ldquo;Git aout! yeh whelp, yeh! What d&rsquo;<i>you</i>
      knaow abaout it!&rdquo; to illustrate his contempt for this canine theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      A third farmer, more practically considerate, took the shivering,
      affrighted beast by the bridle, and led it away from the gulf&rsquo;s edge,
      patting its wet neck compassionately as they went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Seth had found his way through the group to his brother John,
      who stood with his back against a beech tree, springing from the very
      brink of the gulf, his hands in his pockets, his eyes on the trampled
      grass at his feet. A half circle of boys, with one or two girls of the
      school age, stretched about him at some distance, like the outer line of
      an open fan, mutely eyeing him as the second most important figure in the
      tragedy. They separated for Seth to make his way, and made signs to each
      other that the interest was doubled by his arrival. The brothers shook
      hands silently and scarcely looked at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came the sound of a pistol shot from the glen below; somebody said:
      &ldquo;There! they&rsquo;ve killed th&rsquo; off-hoss. Ther&rsquo; goes th&rsquo; best matched team o&rsquo;
      grays in Dearborn Caounty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been down yet, John?&rdquo; Seth asked softly, as the low buzz of
      conversation began about them once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not yet. I suppose I could if I had insisted on it, but when I got
      here, twenty minutes or so ago, they told me here that Timms had got his
      jury together down there, and forbidden anybody coming down till they were
      through. So I&rsquo;ve stayed here. Not that I care about Timms, but&mdash;I can
      wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go down!&rdquo; As he spoke, Seth swung himself around the beech, and
      began the descent, letting himself swiftly down the steep, mossy declivity
      by saplings and roots. His brother followed. One or two boys started also,
      but were roughly restrained by their elders, with a whispered &ldquo;Stay back,
      can&rsquo;t yeh! H&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t yeh got no sense. Them&rsquo;s the brothers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The scene at the bottom was not unlike what Seth&rsquo;s fancy had painted it,
      adding the terrible novelties of the night to a spot he had known from
      boyhood. Half-shaded even in the noon sunlight by overhanging branches
      from the towering, perpendicular sides of the glen, the miniature valley
      lay, a narrow stretch of poor, close-cropped grass, with the spiral, faded
      mullein stalks, the soft brown clumps of brake, the straggling, bloomless
      thistles, and even some tufts of glowing golden-rod, which push their way
      into unfrequented pasture-lands and encompass their sterility. The stream,
      which once had been a piscatorial glory of the section, but now, robbed of
      its water and its life by distant clearings, mills and reservoirs,
      wandered sadly and shallowly on an unnoted course, divided itself here to
      skirt each side of the gulf with a contemptible rivulet&mdash;the two
      coming together abruptly at the mouth of the low stone culvert, and
      vanishing into its dark recesses, above which rose, sloping steeply, the
      high embankment of the road traversing the ravine.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was over this embankment that horses, carriage and owner had
      precipitately pitched; it was at its base, on the swail and gravel of the
      stream&rsquo;s edge, that the wreck lay, surrounded by a little knot of men.
      Vertical gashes in the earth down the bank, with broken branches and tom
      roots, marked the awful track of the descent; the waters of the brook to
      the right, dammed by the body of the horse killed in the fall, had
      overflowed the sands and made muddy rivulets across to the culvert.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Coroner turned with obvious vexation at the sound of the brothers&rsquo;
      approach. &ldquo;I thought I give word&mdash;&rdquo; he began; then, recognizing the
      newcomers, added, without altering his peremptory, officious tone: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      all right; you can come now, if you want to. The gentlemen of the jury
      have completed their labors for the present. I was on the pint of
      adjourning the ink-west.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The brothers joined the jurors, and dumbly surveyed the spectacle at their
      feet. One of the grays lay across the rivulet; the other, more recently
      dead, was piled awkwardly upon its mate&rsquo;s neck and shoulders, in an
      unnatural heap. The front portions of the buggy, scratched but not
      smashed, were curiously reared in the air, by reason of the pole being
      driven deep into the soft earth, between the horses; the rear wheels and
      the seat, broken off and riven by the violence of the shock, were imbedded
      in the marsh underneath. On the higher ground, close in front of the
      brothers, lay something decorously covered with horse-blankets, which they
      comprehended with a sinking of the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He lay in theer, part under the hind wheels &rsquo;n&rsquo; part under the
      nigh hoss,&rdquo; explained the Coroner, with dignity. &ldquo;The fall was enough to
      brek his neck twenty times over, let alone the hosses may&rsquo;ve kicked him on
      the way down. We hev viewed the remains, &rsquo;n&rsquo; we&rsquo;ve decided&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t decided nothin&rsquo;!&rdquo; broke in one of the jurors, a serious, almost
      grim-faced farmer, with a bushy collar of gray whiskers framing his brown
      square jaw. &ldquo;How kin we decide till we&rsquo;ve heerd some evidence, &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      before the ink-west is threw with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some men&rsquo;d kick if they was goin&rsquo; to be hung. Did I <i>say</i>
      we&rsquo;d arrived at a verdict? What I mean is we&rsquo;ve agreed to adjourn the
      ink-west now till arter the funeral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why daon&rsquo;t yeh say what yeh mean, then?&rdquo; rejoined the objecting
      juror. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t no cor&rsquo;ner make up my verdict fur me, &rsquo;n&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll
      fine it aout, tew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The more fool me fur panelin&rsquo; yeh!&rdquo; was the Coroner&rsquo;s comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brothers insensibly edged away from this painful altercation. A little
      elderly man, in shabby broadcloth which seemed strangely out of place
      among the rough tweeds and homespuns of the farmers, detached himself from
      the group of jurors, and came over to them, with a subdued halfsmile of
      recognition. It was the Thessaly undertaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tew bad, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he said glibly, &ldquo;allus some such scrimmage as thet,
      on every one of Timms&rsquo; juries. He ain&rsquo;t got no exec&rsquo;tive ability, <i>I</i>
      say. I&rsquo;d like to see <i>him</i> run a funer&rsquo;l with eight bearers&mdash;all
      green han&rsquo;s! I told him thet once, right to his face! But then of course
      yeh knaow <i>I</i> can&rsquo;t say much. He&rsquo;s techy, &rsquo;n&rsquo; &rsquo;twouldn&rsquo;t
      do fur me to rile him. We hev a kind o&rsquo; &rsquo;rangement, you see. I hev
      to be on hand any-way, &rsquo;n&rsquo; he allus puts me on the jury; it helps
      him &rsquo;n&rsquo; it helps me. I kin always sort o&rsquo; smooth over things, if
      any o&rsquo; th&rsquo; jurors feels cranky, yeh knaow. They&rsquo;ll listen to me, cuz they
      reelize I&rsquo;ve hed experience, &rsquo;n&rsquo; then there&rsquo;s a good deal in
      knaowin&rsquo; haow to manage men, in hevin&rsquo; what <i>I</i> call exec&rsquo;tive
      ability. Of course, this case is peculiar. They ain&rsquo;t no question abaout
      th&rsquo; death bein&rsquo; accidental. But this man you heerd kickin&rsquo;, this Cyrus
      Ballou, he&rsquo;s makin&rsquo; a dead set to hev&rsquo; Zeke Tallman condemned fur hevin&rsquo;
      his fence up there in bad repair. He &rsquo;n&rsquo; Tallman&rsquo;s a lawin&rsquo; of it
      abaout some o&rsquo; his steers thet got into Tallman&rsquo;s cabbages, &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      thet&rsquo;s why&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose we can leave this to you!&rdquo; John broke in, impatience mastering
      the solemnity of the scene. &ldquo;Have you made any arrangements? You know what
      ought to be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my boy ought to be here by this time with my covered wagon, what I
      call my ambulance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The brothers turned away from him. The little man remembered something and
      hurrying after them laid his hand on John&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I spoke abaout allus bein&rsquo; on the jury, you knaow, p&rsquo;raps I ought
      to&rsquo;ve explained.&rdquo; He proceeded with an uneasy, deprecating gesture. &ldquo;You
      see, a juror gits a dollar a day, &rsquo;n&rsquo; sometimes friends of the
      remains think I ought to deduck thet f&rsquo;m my bill, but ef you&rsquo;ll jest
      consider&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh for God&rsquo;s sake! leave us alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Seth who spoke, and the undertaker joined his fellow-jurors at the
      foot of the hill forthwith. The brothers went back, and stood again in
      oppressed silence over the blanketed form.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. William Henry Timms meanwhile conversed apart with his panel. He was a
      middle-aged, shrewdfaced man, who, like so many thousands of other Whig
      babes born in the forties, had been named after the hero of Tippecanoe. He
      was more politician than coroner, more coroner than doctor. He hung by a
      rather dubious diploma upon the outskirts of his profession, snubbed by
      the County Society, contemned by most sensible Thessaly families as &ldquo;not
      fit to doctor a sick cat.&rdquo; But he had a powerful &ldquo;pull&rdquo; in the politics of
      the county, and the office could not, apparently, be wrested from him, no
      matter how capable his opponent.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the earlier years of his official service he had been over zealous in
      suspecting mysteries, and had twice been reprimanded by the Supreme Court
      Judge, and much oftener by the District Attorney, for enveloping in
      criminal suspicion cases which, when intelligently examined, were palpable
      and blameless casualties. These experiences had sensibly modified his
      zeal. He had put the detective habit of mind far away behind him, and,
      like a wise official, bent all his energies now to the more practical
      labor of dividing each inquest into as many sessions as possible. Had he
      been a Federal Deputy Marshal, he could not have been more skilled in this
      delicate art of getting eight days&rsquo; pay out of a three hours&rsquo; case. A bare
      suggestion of mystery at the start, to be almost cleared up, then revived,
      then exploited carefully, then finally dissipated, and all so deftly that
      the District Attorney, who lived at Octavius, would not be inspired to
      come over and interfere&mdash;this was Dr. Timms&rsquo; conception of a
      satisfactory inquest. Occasionally there would be the added zest of an
      opportunity to formally inflict censure upon somebody, and if this
      involved some wealthy or potential person, so much the better: to withhold
      the censure meant tangible profit, to sternly mete it (failing a fair
      arrangement) meant public credit as a bold, vigilant official.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Timms was still turning over in his mind the professional
      possibilities involved in Tallman&rsquo;s bad fence-building, and casually
      sounding his jurors as to their private feelings toward the delinquent;
      the brothers had followed the jury up to the meadow plateau, and were
      standing aloof from yet among their neighbors, answering in monosyllables,
      and following mentally the work of the undertakers&rsquo; squad down in the
      bottom; the farmers were beginning to straggle off reluctantly, the
      demands of neglected work and long-waiting dinners conquering their
      inclination to remain&mdash;when a big carry-all from Tyre drove up on the
      road outside, and a score of men clambered out and over the fence to join
      the group. They had driven post-haste from the Convention, and among them
      were Ansdell, Beekman, and Milton Squires.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ansdell came straight to the two brothers, giving a hand to each with
      a gesture full of tender comprehension. While they talked in low tones of
      the tragedy, they were joined by Abe Beekman; upon the normal eagerness
      and wistful solemnity of his gaunt face there was engrafted now a curious
      suggestion of consuming interest in some masked feature of the affair. He
      was so intent upon this, whatever it might be, that to the sensitive
      feelings of the other three he seemed to dash into the subject with wanton
      brusqueness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How air yeh, Fairchild?&rdquo; he nodded to John, &ldquo;I want somebody to tell me
      this hull thing, while it&rsquo;s fresh. Who knaows th&rsquo; most &rsquo;baout it?
      Where&rsquo;s th&rsquo; Cor&rsquo;ner? What&rsquo;s he done so far?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Obedient to a word from John, the Coroner dignifiedly came over to the
      beech tree, where our little group stood, and listened coldly to a series
      of searching questions put by the Jay County magnate. When they were
      finished he made lofty answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t institooted no inquiries yit. That&rsquo;ll be arranged fur later, to
      convenience the family &rsquo;n&rsquo; the officers of the law. It ain&rsquo;t
      customary, in cases of accident like this, to rush around like a hen with
      her head cut off, right at the start. The law takes these things ca&rsquo;mly,
      sir&mdash;ca&rsquo;mly &rsquo;n&rsquo; quietly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But have you made an examination?&mdash;you are a doctor, I think,&rdquo;
       interposed Ansdell. &ldquo;Have you satisfied yourself when the death occurred?
      Have you learned any of the circumstances of it? Were there any
      witnesses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Coroner looked at the questioner, then at the brothers, as if
      including them in his pained censure, then back again at Ansdell:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know ez it&rsquo;s any o&rsquo; <i>your</i> business,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Who <i>air</i>
      yeh, any way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before anyone else could answer, Beekman spoke: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the next Congressman
      from this deestrick&mdash;nominated by acclamation over at Tyre to-day&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      who <i>he</i> is. But never mind that, what I want to knaow is&mdash;air
      yeh sure he died from an accident? Kin yeh swear to thet ez a doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Toe be sure I kin!&rdquo; responded the official, in a friendlier tone. &ldquo;He was
      simply mashed out o&rsquo; shape by the fall. He come down forty feet, ef it was
      an inch, plum under the horses. They jest rolled over each other, all the
      way down.&mdash;And so this is Mr. Ansdell, I presewm. I&rsquo;m proud to make
      yer acquaintance, sir. Only by the merest accident I wasn&rsquo;t at the
      Convention to-day, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The undertaker came up now to announce that the first stage of his labors
      was completed and that the ambulance wagon was on the road outside, ready
      to start for the Fairchild homestead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We went up by t&rsquo;other side, lower daown the gulf,&rdquo; he explained; &ldquo;&rsquo;twas
      easier, &rsquo;n&rsquo; then there was no shock to yer feelin&rsquo;s. Ef I might be
      &rsquo;lowed to s&rsquo;jest, it &rsquo;ud look kine o&rsquo; respectful to hev all
      these friends of the remains walk two by two, behine the wagon, daown to
      the haouse. Yeh might let the carry-all come along arterwards, empty, yeh
      knaow, ez a sort o&rsquo; token of grief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The suggestion was passively accepted as the proper thing under the
      circumstances, and the little procession began to shape itself on the road
      outside. Seth was moving toward the fence with the others, when the
      thought of the black mare he had ridden to the scene occurred to him. A
      farm-boy was holding the animal a little way off, near some bars opening
      from the meadow to the road. Seth saw Milton getting over the rails&mdash;he
      had been busy on the outskirts of the assemblage gathering accounts from
      those earlier on the ground&mdash;and said to him: &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you get the
      mare, and ride her home, along with the carry-all. I shall walk&mdash;with
      the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cortege had formed just beyond the fateful narrowing of the road,
      where it crossed the gulf, and the men who were to follow Albert to the
      homestead, including all the late comers from Tyre and a few neighbors,
      had looked down the steep declivity, and noted the new breaking away of
      earth on the road&rsquo;s edge, before they passed on to fall in line behind the
      black, shrouded vehicle. The procession had moved some rods when there
      came sounds of excitement from the rear; at these some of the walkers
      turned, then others, and even the driver of the ambulance drew up his
      horses and joined the retrospective gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      The black mare was balking again, on the road directly over the gulf, and
      was crowding back with her haunches tight against the fencing on the side
      opposite to that over which her late master had fallen. It was a moment of
      cruel tension to every eye, for the fence was visibly yielding under the
      animal&rsquo;s weight, and another tragedy seemed a matter of seconds. Milton
      appeared to have lost all sense, and was simply clinging to the mare&rsquo;s
      neck, in dumb affright. Luckily a farmer ran forward at this juncture, and
      contrived to lead the beast forward diagonally away from the spot. Milton
      sat up in the saddle again, turned the mare away from the gulf, and
      galloped off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dummed cur&rsquo;ous thet!&rdquo; whispered Beekman to Seth; &ldquo;does thet mare ack thet
      way often?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never knew her to balk before to-day. She acted like that when I first
      brought her up to the ravine. It <i>is</i> curious, as you say. But animal
      instinct is a strange, unaccountable thing any way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm-m!&rdquo; answered the Boss of Jay County, knitting his brows in thought, as
      the procession moved again.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII.&mdash;ANNIE AND ISABEL.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>nnie found the
      living room of the Fairchild homestead unoccupied. She could hear Alvira
      talking with the Lawton girl out in the kitchen, and from the parlor on
      the other side there came a murmuring sound which she did not comprehend
      at once. As she laid her hand upon the stair door, with the purpose of
      ascending to Sabrina&rsquo;s room, this sound rose to a distinguishable pitch.
      It was a woman&rsquo;s weeping. Annie hesitated, listening for a moment; then
      she turned, rolled one of the parlor doors back, and entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isabel lay buried in the blue easy-chair, her face, encircled by one arm,
      hidden against its back. The great braids of her yellow hair were
      dishevelled and loosened, without being in graceful disorder. Her whole
      form trembled with the force of her hysterical sobbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Annie&rsquo;s touch upon her shoulder she raised her face quickly. It was
      tear-stained, haggard, and looked soft with that flabbiness of outline
      which trouble may give to the fairest woman&rsquo;s beauty when it is not built
      upon youth; over this face passed a quick look of disappointment at
      recognition of Annie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The almost petulant words escaped before Isabel could collect herself. She
      sat up now, wiping her eyes, and striving with all her might for control
      of her thoughts and tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Isabel. I <i>was</i> going up to Sabrina&rsquo;s room, but I heard you
      sobbing here, and I felt that I must come to you. It is all so terrible&mdash;and
      I do so feel for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Terrible&mdash;yes, it <i>is</i> terrible! It was kind of you to come&mdash;very
      kind. I&mdash;I scarcely realize it all, yet. It was such a shock!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, poor dear.&rdquo; Annie laid her hand caressingly on the other&rsquo;s brow.
      She had not come with over-tenderness in her heart, but this unexpected
      depth of suffering, so palpably real, touched her keenly. &ldquo;I know. Don&rsquo;t
      try to talk to me&mdash;don&rsquo;t feel that it is necessary. Only let me be of
      use to you. It will be a dreadful time for you all&mdash;and perhaps I can
      spare you some. I shan&rsquo;t go to the school to-day. Oughtn&rsquo;t you to go up to
      your room now, Isabel, and lie down, and leave me here to&mdash;to arrange
      things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not yet! Perhaps soon I will. My impulse is to stay down, to spare
      myself nothing, to force myself to suffer everything that there is to be
      suffered. I&rsquo;ll see; perhaps that may not be best. But not now! not now! No&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      go! Stay with me. I dread to be left alone; my own thoughts murder me!&rdquo;
       She rose to her feet, and began pacing to and from the piano. &ldquo;Let me walk&mdash;and
      you talk to me&mdash;anything, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what&mdash;it will help
      occupy my mind. Oh, yes&mdash;were you at Crump&rsquo;s last night? I heard them
      come by, late, singing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Isabel, how <i>can</i> we talk of such trivial things? Yes, I was
      there; I was in the singing party, too. It makes me shudder to think that
      at that very minute, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; The girl paused for a moment,
      with parted lips and troubled face, as if pondering some sudden thought;
      then exclaimed, &ldquo;<i>Oh-h!</i> the horse! Could it have been!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could what have been!&rdquo; Isabel stopped in her caged-panther-like pacing,
      and looked deep inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But no, of course not! What connection <i>could</i> there have been! You
      see, after I left the wagon, to cut across by the path at the end of the
      poplars, a horse came galloping like the wind up the road, with some
      figure lying low on its back. We were too far away to see distinctly,
      though the night was so light&rdquo;&mdash;she had insensibly drifted into the
      use of the plural pronoun&mdash;&ldquo;but the thing went by so like a flash
      that it seemed an apparition. And come to think of it, there was an effort
      to avoid noise. I know I wondered at there being such a muffled sound, and
      Seth explained&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped short, conscious of having said more than she intended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seth was with <i>you</i>, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;he met me, quite unexpectedly, by the thorns. He had been out
      walking, he said; the night was too fine to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I heard him go out, an hour and a half at least before the singers
      came by. Did he say anything to you about what had happened, here in the
      house, during the evening?&rdquo; Isabel&rsquo;s azure eyes took on their darkest hue
      now, in the intentness of her gaze into her companion&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only that he had had words with Albert&mdash;poor boy! how like a knife
      the memory of them must be to him now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he tell you what the words were about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he say anything else to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annie grew restive under this persistent interrogation. The habit of
      deference to the older, wiser, more beautiful woman was very strong with
      her, but this did seem like an undue strain upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why yes, no doubt he did. We talked of a number of things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were they? What did he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, really, Isabel, I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The elder woman gave a little click with her teeth and, after a searching
      glance into the other&rsquo;s face, resumed her walk up and down, her hands
      clenched rather than clasped before her, and her movement more feline than
      ever. &ldquo;Well, really you&mdash;what?&rdquo; she said with the faintest suggestion
      of a mocking snarl in the intonation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl drew herself up. It was not in human nature to keep her tone from
      chilling. &ldquo;Really, I think I would better go up to Sabrina. I fancied I
      might be of some service to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Annie! Are you going to speak like that to me?&mdash;<i>now</i> of all
      times!&rdquo; The tone was outwardly appealing. Annie&rsquo;s sense was not skilled
      enough to detect the vibration of menace in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Isabel, not at all. But you make it hard for me. Can you wonder? I
      think to comfort a desolate, stricken woman in her hour of sorrow, and she
      responds by peremptory cross-examination as to what a young man may have
      said to me, in the moonlight. Is it strange that I am puzzled?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange! Is not everything strange around and about me! That I should
      have married as I did; that I, loathing farm life, should have come here
      to live; that I should be waiting here now for them to bring my husband&rsquo;s
      corpse home to me&mdash;is it not all strange, unreal? The conversation
      ought to be to match, oughtn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;&mdash;she spoke with an unnatural,
      tremulous vivacity which pained and frightened the girl&mdash;&ldquo;and so,
      while we wait, I talk to you about young men, and the moonlight, and all
      that. <i>Can&rsquo;t</i> you see that my mind is tearing itself to pieces, like
      a machine in motion with some big rod or other loose, pounding, crushing,
      right and left like a flail! We <i>must</i> talk! Tell me what he said,
      anything&mdash;everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that isn&rsquo;t so easy,&rdquo; Annie replied dubiously, much mistrusting the
      sanity of all this conversation, but pushed along with it in spite of
      herself. &ldquo;He said something about a misunderstanding with his poor
      brother, and then&mdash;then something that I didn&rsquo;t at all understand
      about a temptation, a great temptation leading him to the gates of hell he
      called it&mdash;but you know how Seth is given to exaggerate everything&mdash;and
      then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told you all this, did he. How confiding! How sweet! Go on&mdash;what
      <i>else</i> did he say to you&mdash;in the moonlight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annie felt vaguely that the tone was cruel and hostile. As she paused in
      bewildered self-inquiry, Isabel glided forward and confronted her, with
      gleaming eyes and a white, drawn face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you stop there?&rdquo; she demanded in a swift, bitter whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There <i>are</i> things which&mdash;a girl doesn&rsquo;t like to&mdash;have
      dragged from her in this&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even as Annie was forming this halting halfsentence, a change came over
      the elder woman. She dropped the hand which had been raised as if to
      clutch Annie&rsquo;s shoulder. The flashing light passed from her eyes, and
      something of color, or at least of calm, came back into her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand!&rdquo; she said, simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can see, Isabel, that this is not a time I should have chosen to
      speak of such things to you, if you had not insisted. It seems almost
      barbarous to bring my joy forward, at such a time, and appear to contrast
      it with your affliction. You <i>won&rsquo;t</i> think I wanted to do it, will
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The widow of a day was looking contemplatively at her companion; she had
      effaced from both expression and voice every trace of her recent
      agitation. &ldquo;Are you sure it is all joy?&rdquo; she asked calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t admit it to him. And at first I was not altogether clear about
      it in my own mind. Indeed, with this other and terrible thing, I can
      scarcely think soberly about it, as it ought to be thought of. But still&mdash;you
      know, Isabel, we were little children together&mdash;and I have never so
      much as thought of anybody else.&rdquo; Annie spoke more confidently, as she
      went on; the notion that there had been malevolence in Isabel&rsquo;s tone had
      faded into a foolish fancy: there seemed almost encouragement, sympathy,
      in her present expression. &ldquo;I should have lived and died an old maid if he
      had not come to me. And it comforts me, dear, too, to think that in your
      great trouble I shall have almost a sister&rsquo;s right to be with you, and
      help you bear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel did not respond to this tender proffer of solace. She still stood
      eying her companion reflectively. &ldquo;You are very certain of being happy,
      then?&rdquo; she mused.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sense of discordance touched the girl&rsquo;s heart again&mdash;a something in
      the restrained, calm tone which seemed to sting. She looked more
      searchingly into the speaker&rsquo;s eyes, and read in their blue depths a
      mystery of meaning which froze and silenced her. While Annie looked, in
      growing paralysis of thought, Isabel spoke again, slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your married life at least won&rsquo;t be deadly dull, as mine was. There must
      be great possibilities of excitement in living with a man who can propose
      marriage to a girl&mdash;in the moonlight&mdash;<i>on his way home from
      having murdered his brother!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>

      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Samantha Lawton, the member of the tribe who served as
      maid-of-all-work at the Warren homestead, had a mind at once imaginative
      and curious. From an upper window she had caught sight of the mournful
      procession from Tallman&rsquo;s ravine, winding its way down the hill, in the
      distance. She stole out from the house, whose bedridden occupant could at
      best only yell herself hoarse in calling if she chanced to need anything
      during her absence, and walked up the path by the thorns to the main road,
      over which the cortege would presently pass. Inside the sharp angle of
      shade made at this corner, where the thorns aspiringly joined the poplars,
      there was an old board seat between two trees, the relic of some past and
      forgotten habit of rendezvous, perhaps whole generations old. Samantha
      knew of this seat, and stood on it now; from it, she had a clear view of
      the road in front and, through the tangled thorns, of the meadow-path to
      the left, while there were branches enough about her to render her
      practically invisible. From this coign of vantage Samantha saw some things
      which she had not expected to witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annie Fairchild came suddenly across the line of vision, from the
      direction of the dead man&rsquo;s house, and walked straight to the stile at the
      edge of the thorn row. There was something so curious in the expression of
      her face, as she advanced, that Samantha scented discovery, and prepared
      on the instant an exculpatory lie. But Annie passed the one place where
      discovery was probable, and the hidden girl saw now that the strange look
      had some other explanation. She crossed the stile, and clung to the fence
      post, as if for support; glanced up the road, where now the black front of
      the nearing procession could be discerned; then with a shudder turned her
      face in profile toward her unsuspected observer, and looked vacantly,
      piteously up into the afternoon sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annie&rsquo;s face, with its straight, firm outlines, was not one which lent
      itself to the small facial play of evanescent emotions. Its regular
      features habitually expressed an intelligent, self-reliant composure, not
      easily responsive to shades of feeling. To see this calm countenance
      transfixed now with a helpless stare of anguish was to comprehend that
      something terrible had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood at the stile, desperately clinging to the rail at first, then
      edging into the thorns to be more out of sight, as the ambulance and the
      little file of friends moved slowly by. She noted nothing of the
      peculiarities of the procession&mdash;that most of the silent followers
      were strange men, in city dress&mdash;but only gazed at Seth, walking
      along gravely behind the vehicle, beside his brother John. She saw him
      with eyes distended, fixed&mdash;as of one following the unfolding of a
      hideous nightmare. So long as the party remained in sight, these set,
      affrighted eyes followed him. Then they closed, and the sufferer reeled as
      if in a swoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Samantha&rsquo;s first and best impulse was to get down and go to the agonized
      woman&rsquo;s aid; her second, and controlling, thought, was to stop where she
      was, and see and hear all that was going.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annie seemed to recover her strength, if not her composure. She wrung her
      hands wildly and talked with strange incoherence aloud to herself. Once
      she started, as if to cross the stile again and return to the house of
      mourning, but drew back. At last, walking straight ahead, like one in a
      dream, she moved toward her home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Samantha followed at a safe distance, marvelling deeply.

      shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if it&rsquo;d be tew much for her naow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alvira sighed, and let her eyes wander compassionately from the kneading
      board and its batch of dough to the old, cushioned arm chair by the
      kitchen stove where Aunt Sabrina customarily sat. This last bereavement
      had rendered the hired-girl almost sentimental in her attitude toward the
      stricken old maid&mdash;so much so that when young Samantha Lawton dropped
      in, toward evening, and offered to sit down in this chair, Alvira had
      sharply warned her to take another.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl had brought a note over from Annie to Seth, and was not a little
      vexed that Alvira should have taken it from her, and gone upstairs to
      deliver it herself, instead of allowing the messenger to complete her
      errand. She declined, therefore, to display any interest in the subject of
      the aged aunt, and warmed her hands over the glowing stove-griddles in
      silence. The elder Lawton girl, Melissa, resting for a moment from her
      churning, turned the talk into a more personal channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fur <i>my</i> part, I think it&rsquo;s a pesky shame, where there&rsquo;s three big
      strappin&rsquo; men &rsquo;raoun&rsquo; th&rsquo; haouse, to make a girl wag this old
      chum-dash till her arms are ready to drop off. &rsquo;N&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll tell &rsquo;em
      sao, tew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sh&rsquo;d thought Dany&rsquo;d done it fur yeh&rdquo; said her younger sister, with a
      grin. &ldquo;He allus seemed to me to be soft enough to do all yer work fur yeh,
      ef you&rsquo;d let him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not he! Both he &rsquo;n&rsquo; Leander ain&rsquo;t so much&rsquo;s lifted a finger &rsquo;raoun&rsquo;
      th&rsquo; haouse to-day. They&rsquo;re off daown to th&rsquo; corners, hangin&rsquo; raoun&rsquo; th&rsquo;
      store, &rsquo;n&rsquo; swoppin&rsquo; yarns &rsquo;baout th&rsquo; accident. <i>They</i>
      wouldn&rsquo;t keer &rsquo;f I churned away here till I spit blood. In th&rsquo;
      mornin&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll be awful sorry, of course, &rsquo;n&rsquo; swear he furgot all &rsquo;baout
      Wednesday&rsquo;s bein&rsquo; churnin&rsquo; day. Thet&rsquo;s th&rsquo; man of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;N&rsquo; I s&rsquo;pose Milton never does nothin&rsquo; &rsquo;baout th&rsquo; haouse
      naowadays,&rdquo; remarked Samantha, interrogatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, siree!&rdquo; snapped Alvira. &ldquo;You bet he daon&rsquo;t! He&rsquo;s tew high &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      mighty fur thet! Prob&rsquo;ly he&rsquo;s furgot so much as th&rsquo; name of a churn, even.
      He might git his broadcloth suit spotted, tew. I wouldn&rsquo;t dream o&rsquo; askin&rsquo;
      <i>him</i>. I&rsquo;d ruther ask Seth any day then I hed Milton. <i>He</i> don&rsquo;t
      put on half so many airs, even if he does git thirty dollars a week in
      Tecumseh, &rsquo;n&rsquo; live &rsquo;mong ladies &rsquo;n&rsquo; gentlemen ev&rsquo;ry
      day &rsquo;f his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Melissa rested from her labors again, to say sneeringly: &ldquo;Pritty ladies &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      gentlemen he <i>use&rsquo;t</i> to travel with, there in Tecumsy, accordin&rsquo; to
      all accaounts!&rdquo; Alvira paused in turn, with her arms to the elbow in the
      floury mixing, and an angry glitter in her little black eyes. &ldquo;Ef I was <i>some</i>
      folks, &rsquo;n&rsquo; hed <i>some</i> folk&rsquo;s relations in Tecumsy, &rsquo;pears
      to me I&rsquo;d keep my maouth pritty blamed shut &rsquo;baout what goes on
      there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The retort was ample. There was no answering sound, save the muffled
      splash and thud of Melissa&rsquo;s vigorously-resumed churning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lull in conversation was beginning to grow oppressive when the young
      visitor asked: &ldquo;Haow does th&rsquo; fine lady take it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She seems more opset than anyone&rsquo;d given her credit fur,&rdquo; Alvira
      answered, sententiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Melissa interposed to expand this comment, and rest her arms: &ldquo;Yes, she <i>seems</i>
      opset enough. P&rsquo;raps she <i>is</i>. But then agin, p&rsquo;raps ef you was young
      &rsquo;n&rsquo; good lookin&rsquo;, with blew eyes &rsquo;n&rsquo; a lot o&rsquo; yalleh hair
      thet was all yer own, &rsquo;n&rsquo; you hed a hus-ban&rsquo; twice as old as you
      was, &rsquo;n&rsquo; he sh&rsquo;d fall daown &rsquo;n&rsquo; break his neck, &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      leave you a rich young widder, p&rsquo;raps you&rsquo;d cry yer eyes aout&mdash;when
      people was lookin&rsquo;&mdash;speshly if thet husban&rsquo; o&rsquo; yours left a likely
      young brother who was soft on yeh. When you git as old &rsquo;s I be,
      S&rsquo;manthy, you&rsquo;ll learn ther&rsquo;s a good deal in appear&rsquo;nces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When she gits as old as you air,&rdquo; broke in Alvira, sharply, &ldquo;I hope
      she&rsquo;ll learn better &rsquo;n&rsquo; to blab everythin&rsquo; thet comes into her
      head! You&rsquo;ll let that cream break, ef yeh don&rsquo;t look aout!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t b&rsquo;lieve its within an &rsquo;aour o&rsquo; comin&rsquo;&rdquo; said Melissa,
      wearily resuming her task.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but&mdash;reelly,&rdquo; began Samantha, &ldquo;<i>is</i> Seth&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never you mind whether Seth is or whether he isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered Alvira. &ldquo;A
      young tadpole of a girl like you&rsquo;s got no business pryin&rsquo; &rsquo;raoun&rsquo;
      older folks&rsquo; affairs. You better go home! M&rsquo;tildy may need yeh. Yer
      sister&rsquo;s got her work to dew, &rsquo;n&rsquo; so &rsquo;ve I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This plain intimation produced no effect upon Samantha. She continued to
      warm her hands, which were already the hue of a red apple with the heat,
      and remarked: &ldquo;No, she don&rsquo; want me. Annie said I might stay &rsquo;s
      long &rsquo;s I wanted to. She said she wanted to be left alone. She&rsquo;s
      abaout the wuss broke up girl <i>I</i> ever sot eyes on. You ought to see
      the way <i>she</i> takes on, though. I bet the widder ain&rsquo;t a succumstance
      to her. Ef you&rsquo;d seen what <i>I</i> saw, &rsquo;n&rsquo; heern what <i>I</i>
      heerd this afternoon, I guess you&rsquo;d think so tew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl spoke calmly, with a satisfied conviction that nobody would tell
      her to go home again in a hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; came simultaneously from the kneading-board and the churn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I dunnao,&mdash;I ain&rsquo;t much of a han&rsquo; to blab everythin&rsquo;. A young
      tadpole of a girl like me, yeh knaow, ain&rsquo;t got no business&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come naow! <i>Don&rsquo;t</i> be a <i>fool</i>, S&rsquo;manthy! Ef you&rsquo;ve got
      anythin&rsquo; to say, spit it aout!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus adjured by the commanding tones of Alvira, the girl trifled no more,
      but related what she had seen, while hidden behind the thorns. She had a
      talent for description, and made so much of Annie&rsquo;s stony face and strange
      behavior, that she succeeded in producing an effect of mystification upon
      her listeners scarcely second to that under which she, as an involuntary
      spectator, had labored. The success of her recital was not lost upon
      Samantha, as she went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Et was after th&rsquo; undertaker&rsquo;s waggin &rsquo;n&rsquo; th&rsquo; men&mdash;some gallus
      lookin&rsquo; young fellers, f&rsquo;m Tecumsey I guess, was amongst &rsquo;em&mdash;et
      was after these&rsquo;d all gone by, thet I heerd her talk. She kind o&rsquo; hid
      herself in th&rsquo; bushes while they was a goin&rsquo; by, &rsquo;n&rsquo; stared at &rsquo;em
      like mad, ez fur&rsquo;s she c&rsquo;d folly &rsquo;em. Then she bust aout&mdash;not
      a-cryin&rsquo; mind yeh, fur she never shed a tear&mdash;but wringin&rsquo; her han&rsquo;s
      &rsquo;n&rsquo; groanin&rsquo; &rsquo;n&rsquo; actin&rsquo; &rsquo;s ef she was goin&rsquo; to faint. I c&rsquo;d
      see her jest ez plain &rsquo;s I kin see you stan&rsquo;in&rsquo; there naow, &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      heer her, tew. All to onc&rsquo;t she up &rsquo;n&rsquo; said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young girl stopped here in the narrative abruptly, with a fine
      disregard for the consuming interest with which her companions were
      regarding her; she lifted her nose, and drew two or three leisured sniffs.
      Then she bent down at the side of the stove and repeated them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ther&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; burnin&rsquo; in thet oven,&rdquo; she said at last, confidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Et&rsquo;s th&rsquo; barley. I knowed S&rsquo;briny&rsquo;d traipse off &rsquo;n&rsquo; leave it. She
      allus does;&rdquo; said Alvira, flinging open the oven door, and dragging out
      with her apron a smoking pan of scorched grain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the dense, pungent smudge which temporarily filled the room,
      Samantha was heard to remark with offensive emphasis: &ldquo;We allus drink
      genu-wine coffee over to M&rsquo;tildy&rsquo;s. She&rsquo;s mean enough &rsquo;baout some
      things, but she wouldn&rsquo;t make us swell ourselves aout with no
      barley-wash.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;N&rsquo; sao do we here, tew&mdash;all but S&rsquo;briny!&rdquo; retorted Alvira,
      indignantly. &ldquo;She got use&rsquo; to drinkin&rsquo; it in war-times, when yeh couldn&rsquo;t
      git reel coffee fur love n&rsquo;r money, jes&rsquo; ez all th&rsquo; other farm-folks did.
      On&rsquo;y she&rsquo;s more contrary &rsquo;n&rsquo; th&rsquo; rest, &rsquo;n&rsquo; she wouldn&rsquo;t
      drink nothin&rsquo; else naow, not ef yeh poured it into her maouth with a
      funnel. But go on &rsquo;th yer yarn!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Samantha had to cough a little, on account of the smoke, and then it took
      her some moments to collect the thread of her narrative. But at last even
      the spirit of Tantalus could invent no further delay, and she proceeded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she didn&rsquo;t say much, fer a fact, but they was business in ev&rsquo;ry
      word she did say. Fust she hollered aout&mdash;right aout, I tell yeh: &lsquo;<i>Et&rsquo;s
      a wicked lie! She&rsquo;s a bad, wicked woman!</i> &rsquo; Then she stopped fer
      awhile &rsquo;n&rsquo; put her han&rsquo;s up to her for&rsquo;id&mdash;like this. Then she
      shuk herself, &rsquo;n&rsquo; commenced to climb back over th&rsquo; stile, but she
      seemed to think better of it, &rsquo;n&rsquo; started fer her own haouse,
      like&rsquo;s ef she was a walkin&rsquo; in her sleep, &rsquo;n&rsquo; a groanin&rsquo; to
      herself: &lsquo;<i>Seth a murd&rsquo;rer! Seth a murd&rsquo;rer!</i>&rsquo; Thet&rsquo;s what I heerd!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl put both feet up on the stove hearth, and tilted her chair back
      in conscious triumph. &ldquo;Got &rsquo;n&rsquo; apple handy?&rdquo; she inquired of
      Alvira, carelessly, in the tone of one whose position in life was assured.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this strange recital, involving such terrible suggestions, there
      succeeded a full minute of silence in the kitchen, broken only by the
      ponderous clucking of the high wooden clock. Alvira and Melissa looked at
      each other dumbly&mdash;each for once willing to forego the first word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what d&rsquo;yeh say to <i>thet?</i>&rdquo; finally asked Melissa.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some reflection, Alvira answered, &ldquo;I sh&rsquo;d say S&rsquo;manthy was a lyin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S&rsquo;elp me die, crisscross, I ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo; protested the girl at the stove:
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told it all, jest&rsquo;s it happened, straight&rsquo;s a string. Where&rsquo;s yer
      apples?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alvira meditated again for a moment. Then she said to her subordinate: &ldquo;Go
      down &rsquo;n&rsquo; git that sister o&rsquo; yourn a Spitzenberg&mdash;&rsquo;n&rsquo;
      bring up some cider, yeh might&rsquo;s well, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Melissa had gone, Alvira went over to the &lsquo;younger girl, and gripped
      her sharply by the shoulder: &ldquo;Look here, you, is what you&rsquo;ve be&rsquo;n tellin&rsquo;
      us here honest? Don&rsquo;t lie to <i>me!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honest Injun? Alviry! ev&rsquo;ry word!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alvira returned to her dough, and slapped it savagely into a huge,
      unnatural pancake. She maintained silence until Melissa had returned, and
      not only supplied her sister&rsquo;s wants, but poured out a cupful of the new
      cider for herself, as a proof of her appreciation of the Lawton family&rsquo;s
      supremacy over the existing crisis. Then Alvira spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t &rsquo;tach th&rsquo; least &rsquo;mportance in th&rsquo; world to what
      S&rsquo;manthy heerd. Annie&rsquo;s a school-teacher, &rsquo;n&rsquo; she&rsquo;s be&rsquo;n workin&rsquo;
      pritty hard, &rsquo;n&rsquo; this thing&rsquo;s kind o&rsquo; opset her&mdash;what with
      tendin&rsquo; to her gran&rsquo;mother, &rsquo;n&rsquo; then this teachin&rsquo;, which is
      narvous, wearin&rsquo; kine o&rsquo; work. Thet&rsquo;s th&rsquo; trewth o&rsquo; th&rsquo; matter. <i>I</i>
      kin un-derstan&rsquo; it. She was jest aout of her senses. But other folks won&rsquo;t
      understan&rsquo; it as I dew. Once a hint gits flyin&rsquo; amongst outsiders, who
      knaows where it&rsquo;ll stop? Naow, girl &rsquo;n&rsquo; woman, I&rsquo;ve be&rsquo;n in this
      haouse twenty year &rsquo;n&rsquo; more. I&rsquo;m more a Fairchild than I&rsquo;m anythin&rsquo;
      else. I remember th&rsquo; man in there&mdash;layin&rsquo; dead in th&rsquo; parlor&mdash;when
      he was a youngster, comin&rsquo; home f&rsquo;m college; I remember Seth when he was a
      baby. I ain&rsquo;t got no folks of my own thet I keer a thaousandth part &lsquo;s
      much abaout, nur owe a thaousandth part &rsquo;s much tew, ez I dew this
      Fairchile fam&rsquo;ly. <i>Well!</i> They&rsquo;ve hed trouble enough, this las&rsquo; tew
      year, &lsquo;thout havin&rsquo; any added onto it by th&rsquo; tattlin&rsquo;, gossipin&rsquo; tongues
      of outsiders. I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to <i>hev</i> it! D&rsquo;yeh understan&rsquo;! Ef I heer
      s&rsquo; much&rsquo;s a whisper of this yere crazy school-teacher&rsquo;s nonsense reported
      &lsquo;raound, by th&rsquo; Lord above, I&rsquo;ll skin yeh both alive!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s <i>b&rsquo;en</i> a gossipin&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked Samantha, reproachfully. &ldquo;I
      shouldn&rsquo;t never said a word, ef you hadn&rsquo;t insisted, &rsquo;n&rsquo; called me
      a fool fur holdin&rsquo; my tongue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunnao where you&rsquo;ll gao to when you die, S&rsquo;manthy,&rdquo; said Alvira,
      reflectively. &ldquo;But nao, girls, trewly naow, this mustn&rsquo;t be mentioned. Yeh
      kin see with half &rsquo;n eye what a raow it&rsquo;d stir up. Naow prommus me,
      both o&rsquo; yeh, thet not a word of it shell pass yer lips. Yeh can see fer
      yerself haow foolish it is! Ev&rsquo;rybody knaows he driv off th&rsquo; raoad, &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      killed himself &rsquo;n&rsquo; th&rsquo; hosses by th&rsquo; fall. It&rsquo;s ez plain &lsquo;s th&rsquo;
      nose on yer face. Still it&rsquo;s jest sech cases as this thet people git
      talkin&rsquo; abaout, once they&rsquo;re sot goin&rsquo;&mdash;so yeh <i>will</i> promise
      me, won&rsquo;t yeh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hon&rsquo;r bright, ye&rsquo;ll never say a word to nao livin&rsquo; soul?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They asseverated solemnly, honor bright, and Samantha had a doughnut as
      well as another cup of cider.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The tiresome butter came at last, and the dough passed into a higher form
      of existence through the fiery ordeal of the oven; supper was laid and
      silently eaten; two neighbors, volunteers for the night-watch with the
      dead, came, and were ushered into the gloomy parlor; while apples, cheese,
      doughnuts and a pitcher of cider were placed on the table outside, for
      their refreshment in the small hours. Night fell upon the farm.
    </p>

    <p>
      Melissa Lawton stole out-doors as soon as Alvira retired to her room, and
      made her way through the darkness to the barns. As Albert had done on the
      fatal previous evening, she opened the sliding door of the big stable, and
      called up the stairs to Milton. There was no response, and investigation
      showed that he was not in his room, although the lamp was burning dimly.
      The girl stopped long enough to look over the familiar coarse pictures on
      the walls and the shelf, and then crept down the steep stairs again.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she groped her way through the blackness to the stable door she came
      suddenly in contact with a person entering, and felt herself rudely seized
      and pushed back at arms&rsquo; length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s here? What d&rsquo;yeh want?&rdquo; demanded a harsh voice, which seemed
      despite its gruffness to betray great trepidation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me&mdash;M&rsquo;lissy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along aout here into the light, so I kin see yeh. What a&rsquo; yeh doin&rsquo;
      here, praowlin&rsquo; &rsquo;raoun&rsquo; &rsquo;n th&rsquo; dark, skeerin&rsquo; people fur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Lawton girl&rsquo;s native assurance all came back to her as she confronted
      Milton in the dim starlight outside&mdash;which was radiance by contrast
      with the stable&rsquo;s total darkness&mdash;and she grinned satirically at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a nerve on you like a maouse, I swaow! You trembled all over
      when yeh tuk holt o&rsquo; me, in there. What was yeh skeert abaout? I wouldn&rsquo;t
      hurt yeh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t skeert,&rdquo; the man replied, sullenly. &ldquo;What was yeh after
      in there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was lookin&rsquo; fur you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What fur?&rdquo; The tone was still uneasily suspicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got somethin&rsquo; to tell yeh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo;yeh knaow, I more&rsquo;n half b&rsquo;lieve this thing wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t an accident
      at all. What&rsquo;d yeh say &rsquo;f it sh&rsquo;d turn aout to be a murder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even in this faint light Melissa could see that Milton was much taken
      aback by the suggestion. He thrust his hands into his pockets, pulled them
      out again, shuffled his feet, stammered, and betrayed by other signs
      general among rustics his surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw&mdash;git aout!&rdquo; he said at last; &ldquo;what nonsense! Of caourse &rsquo;t
      was &rsquo;n accident. Didn&rsquo;t th&rsquo; Cor&rsquo;ner say sao? Daon&rsquo;t ev&rsquo;rybody knaow
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Annie Fairchile don&rsquo;t say sao. <i>She</i> don&rsquo;t knaow it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl went on to relate the substance of Samantha&rsquo;s revelations, adding
      unconsciously sundry embellishments which tended to throw a clearer light
      upon Seth as the chief figure in the mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milton listened with deep attentiveness. His slow, inefficient brain
      worked hard to keep up with the recital, and assimilate its chief points.
      When the girl had finished he still thought steadily on this strange
      story, with its unforeseen, startling suggestions. Gradually two items
      took shape in his mind as most important: that Annie believed Seth to be
      the criminal, and hence would be estranged from him; and that if by any
      unexpected means people came to suspect foul play, here were the elements
      of a ready-made suspicion against Seth. The first of these was very
      welcome; it would be time enough to think of the other if a discovery were
      made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What dew I think?&rdquo; he said at last, in response to the girl&rsquo;s repeated
      inquiries. &ldquo;I think thet sister o&rsquo; yourn lied, &rsquo;n&rsquo; I think yeh
      better keep yer maouth, &rsquo;n&rsquo; her&rsquo;n tew, pritty dum shet, ef yeh
      don&rsquo;t want to git into trouble.&rdquo;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>OUSIN Seth&mdash;<i>There
      are reasons why I cannot come to the house again, even to the funeral; and

    </p>
    <p>
      It was this note, scrawled in a hand very unlike Miss Annie&rsquo;s customary
      prim, school-teacher&rsquo;s writing, which Samantha had borne over from the
      Warren house. Seth had studied it, perplexedly, for a long time on the
      evening of its arrival. He ruminated now again upon it, as he walked along
      the road toward Thessaly, the following forenoon. The temptation to
      confide the thing to John, who had stayed over night with him at the
      homestead, and now was walking silently by his side toward the village,
      wavered in his mind. Perhaps John could assist him to comprehend it; but
      then, it would be necessary to explain so much to him first. Finally the
      arguments in favor of confession triumphed, and with a &ldquo;Here, old man;
      this is a letter from Annie. I want you to help me guess what it means,&rdquo;
       he made the plunge.
    </p>
    <p>
      John read the note carefully. &ldquo;What was it you talked about on this
      occasion she refers to, and when was it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was night before last, <i>the</i> night, and I asked her to marry me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what was her answer?&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell you afterward how glad I am to
      hear what you&rsquo;ve just told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it wasn&rsquo;t decisive&mdash;but she admitted that it made her very
      happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you haven&rsquo;t seen her since?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;or yes! I did. I met her just for a moment yesterday forenoon,
      as I was starting out from the house after hearing&mdash;the <i>news</i>.
      We only exchanged a word or two, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she seem angry with you then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what can have happened since? Try and think! She has reasons, she
      says, which she thinks you will understand. When a woman says she has
      &lsquo;reasons&rsquo; she means that some mischief-maker has told her something
      disagreeable. Now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my God! I see it now!&rdquo; Seth stopped short in the road, and clenched
      his fists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She went into the house, and saw Isabel!&rdquo; Seth continued, as if talking
      to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has that got to do with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth looked up at his brother with a blanching face, in which fright and
      amazement blended. &ldquo;What is that line of Congreve&rsquo;s about Hell having no
      fury like a woman scorned?&rdquo; he asked mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was John&rsquo;s turn to stare. Gradually a light began to spread in his
      mind, and make things visible whose existence he had not suspected before.
      &ldquo;Well, you <i>are</i> a simpleton!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I know it?&rdquo; was the pained, contrite response.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brothers walked on a few yards in silence. Then John said &ldquo;Of course,
      you needn&rsquo;t tell me any more of this than you want to&mdash;but at least I
      can ask you&mdash;how <i>much</i> of a fool have you made of yourself up
      at the farm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s hard to say. Just now I&rsquo;m inclined to think that I am the champion
      ass of the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re displaying some sense <i>now</i>, anyway. What have you
      done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t done anything. That&rsquo;s the foolish part of it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John stopped in turn, and looked his brother&rsquo;s face attentively over. &ldquo;Go
      on, now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and tell me what there is of it. There&rsquo;s no use in my
      butting my brains out against a stone wall, guessing at such an
      inscrutable mess as this seems to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to tell&mdash;there isn&rsquo;t anything specially <i>to</i> tell. I
      simply got sort of sentimental about Isabel, you know&mdash;she was lonely
      and disappointed in life, and my coming to the farm was about the only
      chance for company she got, and all that&mdash;and then I found the thing
      might go too far and so I stopped it&mdash;and to clinch the thing, asked
      Annie to marry me. That&rsquo;s what there is of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good as far as it goes. Go on, youngster; out with the rest of
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you that <i>is</i> all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humbug! Annie never wrote this letter on the strength of such
      philandering nonsense as that. You say Isabel must have told her
      something. What <i>was</i> that something? Do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; The answer was so full of despondent pain, that John&rsquo;s sympathy
      rose above his fraternal censariousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, my boy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better make a clean breast of it. It won&rsquo;t
      seem half so bad, once you&rsquo;ve told me. And if I can help you, you know I
      will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I <i>will</i> tell you, John. Night before last, Monday night, I
      had hard words with Albert, up at the house. You know how he sent for me,
      insisted on my coming, and what he wanted. Of course I could only say no,
      and we quarreled. Toward the end we raised our voices, and Isabel, who was
      upstairs, overheard us. Just then he began about me and her&mdash;it seems
      he had noticed or heard something&mdash;and she, hearing her name, took it
      for granted the whole quarrel was about her. I went upstairs, and
      presently he drove out of the yard with the grays. I couldn&rsquo;t sleep, I was
      so agitated by the idea of our rupture, and I went out to walk it off. It
      was while I was out that I met Annie and had the talk I have told you
      about. Then I came home, went to bed, and slept till after ten&mdash;long
      after everybody else had heard the news. I heard of it first from Isabel,
      and she&mdash;she&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came to an abrupt halt. The duty of saying nothing which should
      incriminate the woman rose before him, and fettered his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she&mdash;what?&rdquo; asked John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she somehow got the idea that I had followed Albert out and&mdash;and&mdash;was
      responsible for his death! <i>Now</i>. you have it all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence. They were nearing the four corners, and walking
      slowly. Finally John, with his eyes on the ground, said: &ldquo;And so that&rsquo;s
      what she has told Annie, you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only way I can explain the note.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Annie couldn&rsquo;t possibly believe such a thing as that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;but there&rsquo;s an explanation for that too. Come to think of it, I
      must have said a lot of things to her, that night, which seem now to her
      to fit in with this awful theory. Poor girl! I don&rsquo;t blame her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John answered, after a pause, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use of my saying anything to
      show you what a situation you are in, or to scold you for it. I suppose
      you realize it fully enough. What&rsquo;s more to the purpose, we must consider
      what is to be done. It is safe enough to assume that if Isabel thinks this
      and has said it to one person, either some one else will think it, or she
      will hint about it to another. The thing is too terrible to have even one
      person, even if she were silent as the grave, think about it. The obvious
      thing, I should think, would be to have a postmortem examination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought they always had them at inquests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the Coroner can dispense with one if he and the jury agree that it
      isn&rsquo;t necessary. Timms sent me word that he had decided to dispense with
      one, in this case, &lsquo;out of consideration for the feelings of the family.&rsquo;
      That means, of course, that he wants the <i>Banner</i> to help re-elect
      him next year. But now out of &lsquo;consideration for the family&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll have to
      have one. Don&rsquo;t be so down in the mouth about it, boy; it will all come
      right, never fear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The brothers had reached the solitary building at the corners&mdash;a low,
      dingy store, with its sloping roof turned to the road, and a broad
      platform and steps stretching along its entire front. A horse and vacant
      buggy stood at the hitching-post. John proposed to go in and get some
      cigars, if Turner had any fit to smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their surprise was great at meeting on the steps Mr. Beekman of Jay
      County, who was coming out. After terse salutations had been exchanged,
      Beekman said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucky you fellows come daown jest ez yeh did. I come over this mornin&rsquo;
      a-purpose to see yeh, &rsquo;n&rsquo; yit I didn&rsquo;t quite like to go up to th&rsquo;
      farm. I&rsquo;ve got ever so many things I want to ask yeh, &rsquo;n&rsquo; say to
      yeh.&rdquo; He led the way over to the farther end of the steps, and, following
      his example of sitting down on the platform, they waited curiously for him
      to proceed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fust of all, I was daown to Tecumsy last night, &rsquo;n&rsquo; saw Workman.
      He said you&rdquo;&mdash;turning to Seth&mdash;&ldquo;needn&rsquo;t worry yerself &rsquo;baout
      comin&rsquo; back till yeh was ready. They kin keep th&rsquo; paper runnin&rsquo; for a week
      or sao, while you stay up here &rsquo;n&rsquo; dew yer duty like a Christian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth said he was much obliged, and then asked how it happened that Beekman
      had posted off to Tecumseh&mdash;over seventy miles&mdash;and returned so
      soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there was some things I wanted to see abaout daown there, &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      more thet I&rsquo;m interested in keepin&rsquo; an eye on up here. So I kind o&rsquo; humped
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see you taking such an interest in Ansdell&rsquo;s campaign,&rdquo; said
      John.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beekman&rsquo;s gaunt visage relaxed for a second: &ldquo;So yeh calc&rsquo;late <i>thet&rsquo;s</i>
      what I&rsquo;m buzzin&rsquo; &rsquo;raoun&rsquo; th&rsquo; State fur, do yeh? Yeh never&rsquo;s more
      mistaken in yer life. I&rsquo;ve heerd reports circ&rsquo;latin&rsquo; &rsquo;raoun&rsquo; thet
      ther&rsquo;d be an election a fortni&rsquo;t or so from naow, &rsquo;n&rsquo; thet Ansdell
      &rsquo;n&rsquo; I was concerned in it, but yeh can&rsquo;t prove it by <i>us</i>. We
      ain&rsquo;t s&rsquo; much as give a thought to politics sence th&rsquo; Convention ended. <i>We&rsquo;ve</i>
      got somethin&rsquo; else to occupy aour minds with b&rsquo;sides politics. I got a
      telegraph dispatch from him, sent from New York this mornin&rsquo;, thet I want
      to talk to yeh &rsquo;baout presently, but fust&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ansdell in New York?&rdquo; asked Seth, all curiosity-now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he went on daown, while I got off at Te-cumsy, &rsquo;n&rsquo; I sh&rsquo;d
      jedge from his telegraph thet he&rsquo;d be&rsquo;n on the go some sence he got there.
      But what I want to ask yeh &rsquo;baout is this: Do yeh knaow haow much
      money yer brother hed on him night &lsquo;fore last, when he was&mdash;when he
      met his death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The brothers looked at each other, then at, the speaker, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered
      Seth, finally. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t the least idea. Why do you ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come to that bimeby. Naow next, do you knaow where he was th&rsquo; day
      b&rsquo;fore th&rsquo; Convention?&mdash;thet is, Monday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I can tell you that. He was in New York. He only got back Monday
      evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pre-cisely. Well, naow, do yeh knaow what he went there for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Something connected with politics, I suppose, but I can&rsquo;t say for
      certain. He had business there very often, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I knaow. But he hed very special business this last time. Naow look
      at this telegram.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two took the oblong sheet, and read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>New York&mdash;Oct. 21. 942 A.M. Unexpectedly easy sailing. Found clue
      to money almost without looking. Fancy now must been sixteen instead ten.
      Hope return to-night. Ansdell</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, still I am in the dark,&rdquo; John said, after reading and re-reading
      the dispatch. &ldquo;What is it all about? I suppose you understand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginnin&rsquo; to see a leetle ways threw th&rsquo; millstone, I think, myself,&rdquo;
       replied Beekman. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s all so uncert&rsquo;n yit, I don&rsquo;t want to say
      nothin&rsquo; thet I can&rsquo;t back up later on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth too had been busily pondering the dispatch, and he said now, with a
      flushing face: &ldquo;<i>I</i> know what you think! You and Ansdell have got an
      idea there was foul play!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes, it ain&rsquo;t much more&rsquo;n an idee, <i>yit</i>;&rdquo; assented Beekman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you base your idea on?&rdquo; demanded John, full of a nameless,
      growing fright lest there <i>might</i> be something further which Seth&rsquo;s
      confession had not revealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jest you wait one day more,&rdquo; said the Boss of Jay County, grimly, &ldquo;one
      day more &rsquo;ll dew. Then I miss my guess ef we ain&rsquo;t in shape to tell
      yeh. Fust of all, there&rsquo;s got to be a post-mortem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John&rsquo;s impulse was to say that he and Seth had already agreed upon this,
      but a second thought checked his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;N&rsquo; it&rsquo;ll hev to be on th&rsquo; quiet. Everything depends on thet&mdash;on
      keepin&rsquo; it dark. There&rsquo;s some folks might get skeered, &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      complicate things, ef it ain&rsquo;t kep&rsquo; mum. &rsquo;N&rsquo; thet&rsquo;s what I wanted
      to ask yeh &rsquo;baout. I&rsquo;ve thought of Dr. Bacon, over at Thessaly, &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      Dr. Pierce daown at the Springs. They&rsquo;re both good men, &rsquo;n&rsquo; got
      level heads on &rsquo;em. What d&rsquo;yeh say to them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no objection to them in the world, but the Coroner&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know &rsquo;bout him. He&rsquo;s th&rsquo; blamedest fool in th&rsquo; caounty. Over
      in Jay we wouldn&rsquo;t elect sech a dumb-head to be hog-reeve. But you &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      Ansdell kin fix it with him to-morrow, &rsquo;n&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll drive to-day &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      see both doctors, &rsquo;n&rsquo; put &rsquo;em straight. &rsquo;N&rsquo; naow yeh
      must prommus me, both of yeh, thet yeh won&rsquo;t breathe a word of this to any
      livin&rsquo; soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They promised, and he climbed into his buggy, and gathered up the reins.
      &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s one thing more,&rdquo; he said, on reflection. &ldquo;P&rsquo;raps you wonder
      why I&rsquo;m takin&rsquo; so much on myself. I&rsquo;ll tell yeh bimeby. I&rsquo;ve got my
      reasons. I&rsquo;m mixed up in it, more&rsquo;n you&rsquo;d think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned about, and drove off briskly toward Thessaly. The brothers stood
      in perplexed silence by the roadside for some minutes. There was surely
      enough to think about.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, with a frank gesture, John stretched his hand out to Seth:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old boy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how this thing is coming out, but we&rsquo;ll
      see it through together. You go down to the office and wait for me. You
      might do some things to fill up the paper this week if you&rsquo;ve got nerve
      enough. I&rsquo;m going back to the farm.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX.&mdash;JOHN&rsquo;S DELICATE MISSION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hile Seth tried to
      divert his thoughts at the <i>Banner</i> office by going over the
      freshly-arrived batch of morning dailies, and fastening his attention upon
      their political editorials and reports of speeches instead of their
      displayed and minute reports of the sensational tragedy in Tallman&rsquo;s
      ravine&mdash;John Fairchild retraced his steps toward the farm. He had a
      definite purpose in his mind&mdash;to confront and silence Isabel&mdash;and
      he strove hard as he went along to plan how this should be done, and what
      he should say.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt that his dominant emotion was wrath against this sister-in-law of
      his, and he said to himself as he strode along that he had never liked
      her. He could recall the summer a dozen years before when she came to the
      farm as a visiting cousin. He had been civil to her then, even
      companionable, for she was bright, spirited, in a word good company, but
      it seemed to him now that even then he had suspected the treachery
      ingrained in her nature&mdash;that he had been instinctively repelled by
      those hateful qualities, dormant in her girlhood, which were later to plot
      infidelity to one of his brothers, and lure into trouble, shame, perhaps
      even crime, the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      This latter phase of her work was peculiarly abominable in John&rsquo;s eyes. He
      was not going to get up any special indignation on the first count of the
      indictment; a bachelor of nearly forty who marries a sentimental young
      girl does it at his own risk, John felt, and Albert had invited just this
      sort of thing by exiling her to a farm, and forcing her romantic mind to
      feed on itself. But that she should have selected Seth&mdash;her own
      husband&rsquo;s brother, the Benjamin of the flock, a veritable child in such
      matters&mdash;to practise her arts upon, was grievously unpardonable. To
      be sure, Seth ought to have had more sense. But then John, habitually
      thinking of him as &ldquo;the youngster,&rdquo; thought he could see how he had been
      led on, step by step, never realizing the vicious tendency of it all,
      until he had all at once found himself on the brink of a swift descent.
      Then, to do the boy justice, he seemed to have stopped short, turned his
      back upon the siren, and for the sake of further security, irrevocably
      committed himself to Annie. He had been sadly weak in the earlier stages
      of the affair, no doubt; but this last course appeared manly and sensible&mdash;and
      wholly incompatible, too, with any idea of malice or crime on Seth&rsquo;s part.
      What fault there was belonged-to the woman, and she should be told so,
      too, straight and sharp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus John&rsquo;s thoughts ran as he entered the house, and bade the Lawton girl
      tell her mistress he wished to speak with her. He had not seen Isabel
      since her husband&rsquo;s death&mdash;she having kept her room constantly&mdash;nor
      for a long time previous. They had, indeed, scarcely met more than
      half-a-dozen times since she came to live at the homestead, and then with
      considerable formality on both sides. As he stood by the stove in the
      living-room, awaiting her coming, he knitted his brows and framed some
      curt, terse words of address.
    </p>
    <p>
      She entered, clad in the same black and dark-gray wrapper which his memory
      associated with his mother&rsquo;s funeral, and which gave the effect of height
      and slender dignity to her figure. Her face was pale and pathetic in
      expression, and the ghost of a smile which flitted in greeting over it for
      a second accentuated its stamp of suffering. She offered him her hand, and
      said, in a low mournful voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was good of you to come to me, John. I have been expecting, hoping you
      would. Won&rsquo;t you take off your coat and sit down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had shaken hands with her, loosened his overcoat and taken a seat
      before he had time to reflect that he ought to have ignored her greeting
      and her proffered hand. The sharp words, too, that he had arranged in his
      mind seemed too brusque now to utter to a weak, lone woman who was so
      evidently suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I thought I ought to talk things over with you. You&rsquo;ve
      got nobody else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;not a soul! I couldn&rsquo;t be more wholly alone if I were at the
      North Pole, it has seemed to me this last day. I have eaten nothing; I
      haven&rsquo;t slept an hour. So you must make allowances for me,&rdquo; she said, with
      a weak shadow of a smile, &ldquo;if I seem nervous or incoherent. My mind goes
      all astray, sometimes now, and I seem unequal to the task of controlling
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had thought at last of a question which might introduce the desired
      subject without wounding her feelings. &ldquo;Do you happen to know,&rdquo; he asked,
      gently, &ldquo;whether Albert brought a large sum of money with him from New
      York Monday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least idea, I am sure. In fact, I only saw him for a moment
      after his return. And besides, you know, he never told me a syllable about
      his business arrangements. No one could be in more complete ignorance of
      his affairs than I have always been.&rdquo; There was the tone of resigned
      regret in her voice which a wife might rightly use. &ldquo;I do indeed&mdash;there
      is one exception&mdash;know about his will. He told me that, not by way of
      confidence, but because it came out&mdash;in some words we once had about
      property of mine in New York. I might as well tell you. The will gives
      everything except my third to you and your aunt and&mdash;your brother. <i>He</i>
      has the lion&rsquo;s share. Don&rsquo;t think I am complaining, John. I wouldn&rsquo;t have
      had it altered if I could. I am more than independent, you know, apart
      from right of dower. If I had had the making of the will, it would have
      been just the same. It is only right that his money should go to his
      family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John reflected for some moments before he answered. &ldquo;I am almost sorry you
      told me,&rdquo; he said then. &ldquo;It makes me wretched and ashamed to think of the
      injustice I have done him in my mind. It sounds brutal, in the light of
      what you have told me,&mdash;but I am going to confess it to you&mdash;I
      suspected all along that he intended to come some game over us about the
      farm; and now, instead&mdash;&mdash;. Oh, it&rsquo;s <i>too</i> bad. I wish he
      could hear me!&rdquo; John continued, with a glance toward the folding doors of
      the parlor, once more the chamber of death. &ldquo;I wish he could know how I
      despise myself for having wronged him in my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel said nothing, but her responsive eyes seemed to express
      appreciation and sympathy. John lost all sense of wrath toward her as he
      went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, from the very start we wronged him. We didn&rsquo;t understand him. He was
      different from us&mdash;he was a man of the world, and we were countrymen,
      and we thought all the while that he held himself outside the family. I
      never gave him credit for good motives when he came to the farm; neither
      did Seth. We both thought he was playing his own game, for himself, and
      nobody else. And here, by George! he turns out to have had more brotherly
      feeling, more family feeling, than we ever had. It makes me miserable to
      think of it. It&rsquo;ll break Seth&rsquo;s heart, too; he&rsquo;ll always torture himself
      with the thought that the last time he ever saw Albert alive they parted
      in anger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words were out before he realized their significance. He stopped
      short, and felt himself changing color as he looked at her to see whether
      she too was thinking about that terrible night.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made a motion as if to rise from her chair; then dropped back again
      and returned his inquiring glance with a fixed, intent look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you know something about <i>that</i>,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Seth tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; he answered, falteringly. &ldquo;Seth told me. We had a long talk this
      forenoon. I think he told me about every thing there was to tell. In fact,
      that is mostly why I&rsquo;ve come back now to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent, but her eyes seemed to John to be saying disagreeable
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began again to realize that it was his duty to be indignant in attitude
      and peremptory in tone, but he was also conscious of feeling very sorry
      for Isabel. The village editor often described himself, and was uniformly
      characterized by others, as being &ldquo;no hand for women.&rdquo; His own brief
      career as a married man&mdash;it seemed almost a dream now, and a very
      painful dream, with a short period of great happiness, then a slightly
      longer season of illness, poverty, debt, despair, and then the rayless
      gloom of death in his scarcely established home&mdash;had taught him next
      to nothing of the sex, and inclined him against learning more. The
      impressions of womankind which clustered about the memories of his
      girl-wife were, however, all in the direction of gentleness and softness.
      As he reflected, it grew increasingly difficult for him to put on a harsh
      demeanor toward his sister-in-law. She might deserve it well enough, but
      it was not in his heart to speak ugly words to a pretty and troubled woman
      at such a time. He stumbled on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the youngster is fearfully cut up about the whole thing, and he <i>had</i>
      to talk to somebody. He&rsquo;s always been used to telling me everything. He is
      not a tattler, though, and I&rsquo;m bound to say he only told me because I
      questioned him, and insisted on his making a clean breast of it. Then I
      sent him down to the office, and I came back here, thinking it might be
      best for all concerned to have a frank talk with you about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had a course mapped out now in her mind. &ldquo;I am sure that your motives
      are good, John,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and that you will be fair and candid. I
      confess I don&rsquo;t see what there is to be gained, specially, but you no
      doubt know best. What is it you wanted to talk over?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it isn&rsquo;t easy to state it, off hand. Perhaps I might as well begin
      by speaking of motives, as you did. I own that when I came in I wasn&rsquo;t so
      sure that your motives were good, as you say you are about mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is candid, at all events.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to be perfectly open and above-board with you, Isabel. You seem to
      have got into your head yesterday&mdash;I won&rsquo;t say you have it now&mdash;some
      horrible and ridiculously wild suspicion of Seth&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what you mean,&rdquo; she interposed, with nervous haste. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t
      think of that at all! You mustn&rsquo;t blame me for it! I was simply distracted&mdash;mad&mdash;out
      of my senses. I don&rsquo;t know <i>what</i> awful thing my fancy didn&rsquo;t conjure
      up. Don&rsquo;t pay any attention to that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the mischief of it is that you seem to have spoken of this to&mdash;to
      somebody else. It would have been unimportant otherwise. <i>This</i>
      complicates it badly. Don&rsquo;t you see it does?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made no answer, and kept her eyes on the figures in the carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see it does?&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that I spoke of it to anybody?&rdquo; she asked, after a pause,
      and still with downcast eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That has nothing to do with it, Isabel. It&rsquo;s true, isn&rsquo;t it, that you did
      speak of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To his surprise and embarrassment she began weeping, and hid her face in
      her handkerchief. He sat mutely watching her, wishing that she would stop,
      and perplexed at encountering on the very threshold of his inquiries and
      argument this un-meetable demonstration of a woman&rsquo;s resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      She presently sobbed out, from behind the perfumed cambric: &ldquo;You <i>can&rsquo;t</i>
      hold me accountable for what I did yesterday, or what I said! I was beside
      myself! I scarcely know what I thought, or what I said! I acted like a
      crazy woman&mdash;and felt like one, too! It is easy enough for you to be
      cool and collected about the thing. You are a <i>man!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know, Isabel,&rdquo; he said, kindly, &ldquo;I understand all that, and I can
      make all the allowances in the world for you, in your position. But still
      that doesn&rsquo;t alter the fact that the thing has been said, and the harm
      done. To be sure, I suppose, the harm will be only temporary, but as it
      stands it affects the prospects of more than one person&mdash;of two
      persons, in fact, near to us&mdash;very materially. You know what I mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what can be done to remedy it? That is the question. I am not going
      to blame you, but still the fault <i>was</i> yours, and the steps to set
      it right ought to be yours, too, oughtn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; She looked up now, forgetting her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not quite sure what I do mean. I haven&rsquo;t thought over details. There
      is simply a given situation, with the question how to get out of it, and
      the onus of action on you. I want you to help me think what the best way
      will be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How logically you state it! Suppose I disavowed the whole thing, ignored
      it, refused to do anything or say anything. What then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t consider that at all. You couldn&rsquo;t be so unfair as that&mdash;so
      ungenerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfair! Ungenerous!&rdquo; Isabel rose to her full height, and frowned down at
      her brother-in-law, without a trace of tears in her eyes. &ldquo;Fine fairness,
      distinguished generosity, have been shown to <i>me</i>, haven&rsquo;t they!
      There has been so much delicacy in regarding <i>my</i> feelings! I ought
      to leap at the opportunity of smoothing over matters between Mr. Seth and
      his lady-love. My husband&rsquo;s awful death, my position here, alone in the
      world, the shock and suffering of it all&mdash;these are mere trifles
      compared with the importance of seeing that their love affairs are
      uninterrupted! Perhaps I might get a chance at the funeral to have them
      kiss and make up&mdash;or would you prefer me to leave my dead now and go&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Your</i> dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The brother had risen also, and taken his hat. The exclamation carried in
      its tone all the bitterness with which his mind had stored itself on his
      walk back to the farm. Pity for the woman, perhaps something too of innate
      susceptibility to beauty and grace, had restrained and covered up this
      bitterness, so that he had supposed it gone. It flamed forth now, in
      wrathful satire.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she put her handkerchief up again to her eyes, as a token of more
      tears, he went on, in a cold kind of excitement:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk very cleverly&mdash;more so than any other woman I ever knew.
      But you should pick your strong phrases with more discrimination. For
      instance, when you want to produce a really striking effect upon me, it is
      unwise to use an expression which recalls to me at once things that you
      would rather I didn&rsquo;t think about. I wouldn&rsquo;t say &lsquo;<i>my</i> dead &rsquo;
      if I were you, especially when you are talking to his brother. It may do
      for outsiders, but here in the family it is a bad waste of words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her only answer was a gust of sobs. They failed to move him and he went
      on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I have any means of forcing you to do anything, or say
      anything, against your will. If you take that position, perhaps it won&rsquo;t
      be necessary. The wicked, ridiculous thing you thought, or pretended to
      think, and said to that poor girl, can be straightened out very easily. We
      can&rsquo;t prevent the pain it has already caused, but we can stop its causing
      more. But if you lisp it to another human being&mdash;well, I don&rsquo;t know
      what to threaten you with. It isn&rsquo;t easy to guess what considerations will
      weigh with a woman who has your ideas of wifely duty, and of her
      responsibilities towards young and foolish members of her husband&rsquo;s
      family, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How <i>can</i> you be so cruel, so mean, John? What right have you to
      talk to me like that? Everybody attacks me like an enemy. You never have
      been decent to me since I was married. Your whole family has treated me
      like an outsider, almost a criminal, since I came here. Your old cat of an
      aunt never looked at me except to wish me evil. Your brother&mdash;yes, if
      he could hear me now, from where he lies, I would say it!&mdash;never was
      fond of me, never tried to make a companion of me, never treated me as a
      wife should be treated, or even as his intellectual equal. <i>You</i>
      avoided me as if I were poison. The neighborhood disliked me, gossiped
      about me, and I hated them. Only one there was of you all who was pleasant
      with me, and good to me&mdash;and now that you have turned him against me,
      too, you come and insult me because I was pleased and grateful for his
      friendship. That is <i>manly</i> isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John had listened to the beginning of this impassioned speech with a
      callous heart. But he was a just man, and he had in almost unmeted degree
      that habit of mind which welcomes statements of both sides of a
      controversy. He might have been a wealthier man, and the owner of a more
      thriving paper, if he had had more of the partisan spirit. But to be
      strictly fair was the rule of his being. He would not criticise political
      opponents for doing things which in his heart he approved, and, on the
      same principle he would not condemn unheard even this woman, if she had
      any justification. As she went on, he began to feel that there was
      considerable force in her argument. She certainly had been most
      disagreeably situated, connubially and socially, and her definition of the
      Seth episode was plausible, if that were all there was of it. He softened
      perceptibly in tone as he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am sorry if you think I wanted to insult you. Perhaps I did speak
      too strongly. I apologize for it. But I feel very earnestly on this
      subject. I&rsquo;ve always been a sort of father and big brother combined to
      Seth, and the idea of his getting into a mess, or doing foolish or
      discreditable things, cuts me to the quick. You can see my position in the
      matter. I am anxious not to hurt your feelings, but my first duty is to
      him. Perhaps the two need not come into conflict. After all, no real harm
      has been done, I fancy, except in this one case of repeating your
      hysterical suspicion of him. <i>That</i> was inexcusable; can&rsquo;t you <i>see</i>
      that it was? I&rsquo;m sure that if you&rsquo;ll think it over calmly, you&rsquo;ll be
      disposed to do what is fair and right. I&rsquo;m not blaming you particularly
      for the other thing. You might have remembered that you were older than
      Seth, to be sure, but then I realize that you were not at all pleasantly
      placed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind what you realize! We won&rsquo;t discuss that at all. There is
      nothing to discuss. You and your aunt seem bound to make yourselves
      ridiculous about me. I won&rsquo;t demean myself by answering&mdash;or no! I <i>will</i>
      say this much to you. There has never a word passed between Seth and me
      that every soul of you might not have heard, and welcome. He was simply
      pleasant and friendly to me&mdash;and I was grateful to him and fond of
      him, as I might be of a brother. Where was the harm? In no decent state of
      society would any one ever have dreamed of suspecting wrong. But <i>here</i>&mdash;why,
      people live and breathe suspicion! It is the breath of their nostrils.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you used to correspond,&rdquo; John said, tentatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Correspond! There it is again! What of it, I should like to know? Why
      shouldn&rsquo;t my cousin, my brother, write to me? I have all the letters;&mdash;you
      may see them every one. They gave me a great deal of pleasure. They
      represented my sole point of contact with civilization, with fine feelings
      and pretty thoughts. But you can go over them all, if you like. You won&rsquo;t
      find a single whisper of proof of your aunt&rsquo;s mean suspicion. I am almost
      ashamed of myself for having stooped to defend myself&mdash;but it is just
      as well to let you know the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; John breathed a sigh which was not altogether of relief, but
      carried a fair admixture of bewilderment. This ingenious explanation did
      not at all points tally with the inferences drawn from Seth&rsquo;s confession.
      Perhaps it was true enough in the letter, but he felt that as a revelation
      of the spirit it left much to be desired. He added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am sorry if I misjudged you. Probably I did. However, even if
      Seth had come near getting into a scrape, he&rsquo;s safe out of it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This complaisant conclusion nettled-the woman. She went on, as if her
      explanation had not been interrupted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, we had what you might call a community of grievance to talk
      about, and draw us together. It wouldn&rsquo;t be fitting in me to say more now
      than that my life here was not congenial: you won&rsquo;t mind my saying <i>that</i>
      much? I had dreamed of a very different kind of married existence. Seth,
      too, had his trouble. In his boyhood, when it seemed assured that he was
      to remain the farmer of the family, his mother had planned a marriage for
      him. It isn&rsquo;t for me to say a word against Annie. She is a good enough
      girl, in her way. But when Seth got out of his chrysalis, and learned what
      there really was in him, the thought that he was committed in a sense to
      marrying a farm girl made him very gloomy. He used to talk with me about
      it, not saying anything against Annie, mind you, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do!&rdquo; said John, curtly. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t go into that. Evidently there
      was no limit to Seth&rsquo;s asininity. Let that pass. Whatever he said, or
      didn&rsquo;t say, during his vealy period, he&rsquo;s going to marry Annie now. There
      never was a time, and I fear there never will be one, when I would not
      call her his superior. The question is: Are you going to retract before
      her the false, cruel things you have said?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going upstairs again,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think I will lie down awhile,&rdquo;
       and moved towards the stair-door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brother looked at her, amazed, pained, indignant. She had her hand on
      the latch by the time his emotions found words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wasted my time in pitying you. God forbid that any of our family,
      young or old, should ever fall in with such a woman as you are again!&rdquo; He
      pulled on his hat and left the house.

      CHAPTER XXXI.&mdash;MILTON&rsquo;S ASPIRATIONS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he lamps were
      lighted in the little partitioned-off square which served as the editorial
      room of the <i>Banner</i> when John returned. He found Seth weakly
      striving to write something for the editorial page, and in substance laid
      the situation before him. He was not feeling very amiably toward his young
      brother at the moment, and he spoke with cold distinctness. The tone was
      lost upon Seth, who said wearily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that it makes much difference&mdash;her refusing. What good
      would it have done, if she <i>had</i> gone to Annie? She could only tell
      her that she had abandoned such and such ideas. That isn&rsquo;t what counts.
      The fact of importance is that she ever entertained them, that they ever
      existed. To my notion, there&rsquo;s nothing to do but to wait and see what
      comes of Beekman&rsquo;s suspicions. What do you think of them, anyway? I have
      been trying to imagine what he is aiming at, but it puzzles me? What do
      you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell the truth, I haven&rsquo;t been thinking of that. My mind has been
      occupied with the female aspects of the thing. I&rsquo;m not impatient.
      Evidently Beekman and Ansdell think they have got hold of something. They
      are not the men to go off on a wild-goose chase. Very good: I can wait
      until they are ready to explain. But what I can&rsquo;t wait for&mdash;or bear
      to think about&mdash;is poor Annie, suffering as she must be suffering to
      have written that letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve thought of that, too, but I&rsquo;m helpless. I can&rsquo;t think of
      anything: I can&rsquo;t do anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to be of much use, for a fact,&rdquo; mused the brother. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      tell you what I&rsquo;ll do, if you think best. To-morrow afternoon, after I&rsquo;ve
      seen Ansdell, or before that if he doesn&rsquo;t come, I will go over and see
      Annie myself. I can go over to the school-house by the back road, and walk
      home with her. Perhaps by that time, too, I shall have something tangible
      to explain to her. Until then, I suppose she must continue in suspense. It
      is the penance she ought to do, I dare say&mdash;&rdquo; the brother added this
      in mildly sarcastic rebuke&mdash;&ldquo;for the luxury of being in love with
      such a transcendant genius as you are.&rdquo;

      Something like an hour before this, Annie had dismissed her classes and
      locked up the school-house for the night. As she did so, she mentally
      wondered if she should ever have the strength to walk home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day had been one long-drawn out torture from its first waking moments&mdash;indeed
      there seemed to have been nothing but anguish since her interview with
      Isabel the previous day, not even the oblivion of sleep. Her impulse, and
      her grandmother&rsquo;s advice, had been to remain at home; but she had already
      left the school unopened on the fatal Tuesday, in the shock of the news of
      Albert&rsquo;s death: to absent herself a second day might prejudice the
      trustees against her. Besides, the occupation might serve to divert her
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the trustees were satisfied, she said to herself now, locking the
      door, but there certainly had been no relief in the day&rsquo;s labor. The
      little children had been unwontedly stupid and trying; the older boys,
      some of them almost of her own age, had never before seemed so unruly and
      loutishly impertinent. Even these experiences alone would have availed to
      discourage her; as it was they added the stinging of insects to her great
      heartache. With some organizations, the lesser pain nullifies the other.
      She seemed to have a capacity for suffering, now, which took in, and made
      the most of, every element of agony, great and small. She turned from the
      rusty, squat little old building and began her journey homeward, with
      hanging head and a deadly sense of weakness, physical and spiritual,
      crushing her whole being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milton Squires had been watching for her appearance for some time, from a
      sheltering ridge of berry-bushes and wall beyond the school, and he
      hurried now to overtake her, clumsily professing surprise at the meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I jes happened up this way,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Dunnao <i>when</i> I be&rsquo;n up here
      on this road b&rsquo;fore. Never dreampt o&rsquo; seein&rsquo; yeou.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made answer of some sort, as unintelligible and meaningless to herself
      as to him. She did not know whether it was a relief or otherwise that he
      was evidently going to walk home with her. Perhaps, if she let him do all
      the talking, the companionship would help her to get over the ordeal of
      the return less miserably. But she could not, and she would not, talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I kind o&rsquo; thought mebbe you&rsquo;d shet up schewl fer a week &rsquo;r sao,&rdquo;
       he proceeded, ingratiatingly, &ldquo;but then agin I said to m&rsquo;self &lsquo;no siree,
      she ain&rsquo;t thet kine of a gal. Ef she&rsquo;s got any work to dew, she jes&rsquo; does
      it, rain &rsquo;r shine&rsquo;. Thet&rsquo;s what I said. Pooty bad business, wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
      it, this death of yer cousin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dreadful!&rdquo; she murmured, wishing he would talk of something else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, it&rsquo;s about&rsquo;s bad&rsquo;s they make &rsquo;em. Some queer things &rsquo;baout
      it tew. I s&rsquo;pose yeh ain&rsquo;t heerd no gossup &rsquo;baout it, hev yeh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she whispered with a sinking heart; a real effort was needed to
      speak the other words: &ldquo;What gossip? Is there gossip?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dunnao&rsquo;s yeh kin call it real gossup. P&rsquo;raps nobuddy else won&rsquo;t &rsquo;spicion
      nothin&rsquo;. But to me they&rsquo;s some things &rsquo;baout it thet looks darned
      cur&rsquo;ous. Of caourse, it ain&rsquo;t none o&rsquo; my business to blab &rsquo;baout
      the thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These little words, spoken falteringly, confirmed all that Milton had
      wished to learn the truth about. Over night a stupendous scheme had
      budded, unfolded, blossomed in his mind. Originally his primitive
      intellect had gone no further than the simple idea of committing homicide
      under circumstances which would inevitably point to an accident. The plan
      was clever in its very nakedness. But through some row among the women,
      probably out of jealousy, the hint of murder had been raised, and coupled
      with Seth&rsquo;s name. If this hint ripened into a suspicion and an inquiry, a
      new situation would be created, but Milton could not see any peril in it
      for him, for Seth would obviously be involved. But it would be better if
      no questions of murder were raised at all, and matters were allowed to
      stand. This would not only place Milton&rsquo;s security beyond peradventure,
      but it would give him a tremendous grip upon Annie. It was in this
      direction that his mind had been working steadily since he heard of
      Annie&rsquo;s suspicions. The opportunity seemed to have come for placing the
      cap-stone of acquisition upon the edifice of desire he had so long and
      patiently been rearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the poor girl, she had reasoned herself out of the suspicion of
      Seth&rsquo;s guilt a thousand times, only to find herself hopelessly relapsing
      into the quagmire. Milton&rsquo;s hints came with cruel force to drag her back
      now, this time lower than ever. Even he seemed to know of it, but he
      proposed to maintain silence. Of course, he <i>must</i> be induced to keep
      silent. Oh! the agony of her thoughts!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;n&rsquo; Seth was allus kine o&rsquo; frenly,&rdquo; he proceeded. &ldquo;Way back f&rsquo;m
      th&rsquo; time yeh was boys &rsquo;n&rsquo; gals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we always were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;N&rsquo; they used to say, daown to th&rsquo; corners, that yeou two was
      baoun&rsquo; to make a match of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t anything in that at all!&rdquo; She spoke decisively, almost
      peremptorily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t, ay?&rdquo; There was evident jubilation in his tone.
      &ldquo;Never was nothin&rsquo; in that talk, ay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pair walked along on the side of the descending road silently for some
      moments. A farmer passed them, hauling a load of pumpkins up the hill, and
      exchanged a nod of salutation with Milton. This farmer remarked at his
      supper-table an hour later, to his wife: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d bet a yoke o&rsquo; oxen thet
      Milton Squires is a&rsquo;makin&rsquo; up to the schewl-teacher. I seed &rsquo;em
      walkin&rsquo; togither daown th&rsquo; hill to-night, &rsquo;n&rsquo; he was a lookin&rsquo; at
      her like a bear at a sap-trough. It fairly made me grit my teeth to see
      him, with his broadcloth cloze, &rsquo;n&rsquo; his watch-chain, &rsquo;n&rsquo; his
      on-gainly ways.&rdquo; To which his helpmeet acidulously responded: &ldquo;Well, I
      dunnao&rsquo;s she c&rsquo;d dew much better. She&rsquo;s gittin&rsquo; pooty well along, &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      fer all his ongainly ways, I don&rsquo;t see but what he comes on, &lsquo;baout&rsquo;s
      well&rsquo;s some o&rsquo; them thet runs him daown. A gal can&rsquo;t jedge much by a man&rsquo;s
      ways haow he&rsquo;ll turn aout afterwards. <i>I</i> thought <i>I&rsquo;d</i> got a
      prize.&rdquo; Whereupon the honest yeoman chose silence as the better part.
    </p>
    <p>
      The red sun was hanging in a purplish haze over the edge of the hill as
      the two descended, and the leaves from Farmer Perkins&rsquo;s maples rustled
      softly under their feet. Milton drew near his subject:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve be&rsquo;n gittin&rsquo; on in th&rsquo; world sence yeou fust knew me, hain&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, everybody says so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;N&rsquo; yit everybody don&rsquo;t knaow half of it. I ain&rsquo;t no han&rsquo; to tell
      all I knaow. Ef some folks c&rsquo;d guess th&rsquo; speckle-ations I be&rsquo;n in, &lsquo;n&rsquo; th&rsquo;
      cash I&rsquo;ve got aout in mor&rsquo;giges &rsquo;n&rsquo; sao on, it&rsquo;d make &rsquo;em
      open their eyes. It&rsquo;s th&rsquo; still saow thet gits th&rsquo; swill, as my mother
      use&rsquo; to say, &rsquo;n&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve be&rsquo;n still enough abaout it, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His coarse chuckle jarred on the girl&rsquo;s nerves, but the importance of
      placating him was uppermost in her mind, and she answered, as pleasantly
      as she could:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m glad, Milton. You have worked hard all your life, and you
      deserve it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yeh <i>air</i> glad, reely naow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why yes! Why shouldn&rsquo;t I be? It always pleases me to hear of people&rsquo;s
      prosperity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But me purtic&rsquo;ly?&rdquo; he persisted, earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she replied, absent-mindedly. Then the odd nature of the
      question occurred to her, but she was too distrait to think consecutively,
      and she added no comment to her answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it eases me to hear yeh say thet,&rdquo; he went on, with awkward
      deliberation, &ldquo;fer they&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve be&rsquo;n wantin&rsquo; to say to yeh fer a
      long time. I don&rsquo;t s&rsquo;paose you reelize haow well off I am?&rdquo; She did not
      answer. Her mind seemed to refuse to act, and she heard only the sound of
      his words. He took her reply for granted and continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I c&rsquo;d eena&rsquo;most buy up thet farm there&rdquo;&mdash;pointing over to the
      Fairchild acres on the slope, now within sight&mdash;&ldquo;&rsquo;n&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t
      so all-fired sure yit thet I won&rsquo;t, nuther! But what&rsquo;s th&rsquo; good o&rsquo; money,
      on-less yeh kin git what yeh want with it, ay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The impulse of her soul-weariness was to let this aimless question pass
      like the other, without reply. But she was reminded of the importance of
      being pleasant to this tedious man, and so answered, entirely at random:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you want, Milton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunnao&mdash;I&rsquo;m kind o&rsquo; feared o&rsquo; puttin&rsquo; my foot in it; yeh won&rsquo;t be
      mad ef I tell yeh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why no, of course not. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; he blurted out, &ldquo;I want <i>yeou!</i>&rdquo; The girl looked dumbly
      at him, at first not realizing at all the meaning of his words, then held
      as in a vise between the disposition to reply to him as he deserved and
      the danger, the terrible danger, of angering him. There fluttered through
      her senses, too, a mad kind of yearning to shriek with laughter&mdash;born
      of the hysterical state of her long-oppressed nerves. She eventually
      neither rebuked nor laughed, but said vacuously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want <i>me?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ef yeou&rsquo;ll marry me, I&rsquo;ll make one o&rsquo; th&rsquo; fust ladies o&rsquo; Dearb&rsquo;rn Caounty
      aout o&rsquo; yeh. Yeh need never lay yer finger to a stitch o&rsquo; work agin, no
      more&rsquo;n Is&rsquo;bel did, daown yander.&rdquo; He spoke eagerly, with more emotion in
      his strident voice than she had ever heard there before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The difficulty of her position crushed her courage. Of course she must say
      no, but how do it without affronting him? The idea of reasoning him gently
      out of the preposterous wish came to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is some flying notion in your head, Milton,&rdquo; she said, civilly. &ldquo;You
      will have forgotten it by next week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgott&rsquo;n it, ay! Yeh think sao? What &rsquo;f I told yeh I hain&rsquo;t
      thought o&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; else fur nigh onto ten year?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His tone was too earnest and excited to render further trifling safe. He
      pulled out of an inner pocket and held up before her a little, irregularly
      squared tin-type&mdash;which she recognized as having been made in
      whimsical burlesque of her lineaments by an itinerant photographer years
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you come by that?&rdquo; she asked, to gain time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got it fr&rsquo;m th&rsquo; man thet made it, &rsquo;n&rsquo; I paid a dollar bill fer
      it, tew,&rdquo; he answered triumphantly, &ldquo;&rsquo;n&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve kep it by me ever
      sence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a pause she said, as calmly as she could: &ldquo;I never dreamed that such
      a thought had entered your head. Of course, it&mdash;it can&rsquo;t be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not, I&rsquo;d like to knaow?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t yeh b&rsquo;lieve what I&rsquo;ve
      told yeh &rsquo;baout my bein&rsquo; well off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That hasn&rsquo;t anything to do with it. There are other reasons&mdash;a good
      many other reasons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What air they?&rdquo; His tone was peremptory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I can explain them to you. But truly there are so many
      of them&mdash;and your words took me so wholly by surprise, that&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yeh needn&rsquo;t mince matters! I <i>knaow!</i> Yeh hev sot yer idees on Seth!
      Yeh needn&rsquo;t tell me yeh hain&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t talk with you at all if you shout at me in that way, and
      contradict me flat when I assure you to the contrary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Milton paused for a moment, to consider the situation. They were
      approaching the poplars now, along the lonely turnpike, and the
      conversation could not be much protracted. What he had to say must be said
      without delay. But what was it that he wished to say? A dozen inchoate
      plans rose amorphously to the surface of his mind&mdash;to cajole her, to
      strive further to impress her with his wealth, to entreat her, to attempt
      to bully her. This last resource ran best with his mood, but there were
      difficulties. Annie was the reverse of a cowardly girl; there was nothing
      timid or tremulous about her; if he attempted to intimidate her, the
      enterprise would most probably be a ridiculous failure, for he stood too
      much in awe of her self-reliance and intelligence to have confidence in
      his own mastery.
    </p>
    <p>
      But stay&mdash;she was fearful about Seth. Whether it was true or not that
      she had no idea of marrying her cousin, she was evidently solicitous for
      his safety. An idea born of this conclusion swiftly engrafted itself upon
      the hired man&rsquo;s general strategy. He lifted his light, shifty eyes from
      the grass of the roadside path to her face, once more, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, ef you&rsquo;re a mine to be mean, I kin be mean tew&mdash;meaner &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      pussly. Ef yeh think I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to stan&rsquo; still, &rsquo;n&rsquo; let yeou &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      Seth hev it all yer aown way, yer mistaken. I&rsquo;ve only got to open my
      maouth to th&rsquo; Cor&rsquo;ner, &rsquo;n&rsquo; whair&rsquo;d <i>he</i> be, &rsquo;n&rsquo; yeou
      tew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a certain indefinable suggestion of bravado in his tone which
      caught Annie&rsquo;s attention. It was the barest, most meagre of shadows, but
      she grasped at the chance of substance behind it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you could say anything, or do anything, which would
      injure him,&rdquo; she said, with more confidence in her words than she felt in
      her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yeh daon&rsquo;t, ay!&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;Ef yeh knaowed what I knaow, p&rsquo;raps
      yeh&rsquo;d change yer teune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know, then? Come now, let us hear it!&rdquo; She grew defiant, with
      an instinctive sense that the inferior being beside her was ready to
      retreat, if only she could keep up her boldness of front.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never yeou mind what I knaow!&rdquo; he answered, evasively. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be enough,
      I guess, to cook <i>his</i> geuse, when th&rsquo; time comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I thought so!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;You were simply talking to hear
      yourself talk&mdash;to scare me. Well, you see now that you wasted your
      breath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>did</i> I! Well, I won&rsquo;t waste any more of it, then, till I talk
      to th&rsquo; Cor&rsquo;ner. I kin tell him some things &rsquo;baout who rid th&rsquo; black
      mare aout thet night, after Albert&rsquo;d gone. Guess thet&rsquo;ll kind &rsquo;o&rsquo;
      fix things!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His slow imagination, working clumsily in the mazes of falsehood, had
      carried Milton a step too far; his simple plan of substituting Seth for
      himself in the events of the fatal night miscarried in a way he could not
      suspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annie did not answer. An exclamation had risen to her lips, but something
      akin to presence of mind checked it there. Her brain seemed to be working
      with lightning flashes. The black mare had played a part in the tragedy,
      then; Seth had certainly not had the animal out that evening; the rushing,
      almost noiseless apparition which had startled them in the moonlight must
      have been the mare; it was coming from the direction of Tallman&rsquo;s; it had
      a rider; who could that rider have been? and how did Milton know about it?&mdash;so
      the swift thoughts ran, in a chain which seemed luminous in the relief it
      brought to her. These two questions she could not answer&mdash;in her joy
      at the apparent exculpation of Seth it did not seem specially important
      that they should be answered&mdash;and she had self-possession enough to
      ask nothing about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a nice question what she should say to her companion, who was now,
      without any distinct suspicions on her part, growing luridly loathsome and
      repugnant in her eyes. The fear of angering him had died away, but a vague
      sense that mischief might be done by arousing his curiosity or
      apprehensions had come to take its place. She spoke cautiously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t do anything rash, that you would regret afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They ain&rsquo;t nao need o&rsquo; my doin&rsquo; nothin&rsquo;, ef yeou&rsquo;d only hev some sense.
      But if yeou&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to be agin me, ther&rsquo;s nao tellin&rsquo; what I won&rsquo;t dew,&rdquo;
       he answered with sullen terseness.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had come to the poplars, and Annie stopped at the stile under the
      thorns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have to leave you here,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then yeh won&rsquo;t hev me, ay? Yeh better think twice &rsquo;fore yeh say
      nao! Yeh won&rsquo;t git another sich a chance&mdash;to live like a lady, &rsquo;n&rsquo;
      hev ev&rsquo;rything yeh want. &rsquo;N&rsquo; ef yeh dew say nao, yeh kin rest &rsquo;sured
      yeh ain&rsquo;t heerd th&rsquo; last of it, ner him nuther.&rdquo; Milton&rsquo;s little
      green-gray eyes watched her face intently, and he fingered his flaring
      plated watch-chain with nervous preoccupation. &ldquo;What d&rsquo;yeh say, yes&rsquo; &rsquo;r
      nao?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say anything more than I have said&mdash;<i>now</i>,&rdquo; she
      answered, and, stepping over the stile, left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time afterward Annie&rsquo;s conscience debated the justification of
      that final word, the last one she ever addressed to Milton, and which was
      obviously intended to keep alive a hope that she knew to be absurdly
      without ground or reason. Sometimes even now she has momentary doubts
      about it&mdash;but she silences cavil by whispering to herself in
      unanswerable defence: &ldquo;I thought then that possibly it might be needed to
      help Seth&mdash;perhaps even to save him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had little leisure just then, however, to devote to moral
      introspection, for Samantha met her, half-way down the thorn-walk, to
      excitedly tell her that her grandmother, Mrs. Warren, was very much worse
      than usual.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII.&mdash;&ldquo;A WICKED WOMAN!&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen Isabel looked
      into her mirror next morning, the image shown back fairly startled her.
      Day by day during this eventful week the glass had helped her to grow
      familiar with reddened eyes, with harsh, ageing lines, and with a pallor
      which no devices of the toilet could efface. It was not so much an added
      accentuation of these which riveted her gaze, now, upon the mirror, as the
      suggestion of a new face&mdash;of a stranger&rsquo;s countenance, reflecting
      meanings and thoughts of the uncommon kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      She studied the face at first with an almost impersonal interest; then as
      the brain associated these lineaments with her own, and made their
      expression a part of her own spiritual state, she said to this other self
      in the glass, audibly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another week of this will make you an old woman.&rdquo; She added, after a
      pause of fascinated yet critical scrutiny: &ldquo;Yes, and a wicked woman, too!&rdquo;
       There has been what one can only hope is an intelligible reluctance, from
      the beginning of this recital, to essay analysis or portrayal of Isabel&rsquo;s
      thoughts and motives. A complex, contradictory character like hers,
      striving now to assimilate, now to sway the simple, straightforward,
      one-stringed natures with which it is environed, may be illustrated; it is
      too great a task to dissect it. Yet for the once we may venture to look
      into this troubled mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wicked woman! The phrase which she had addressed aloud to the mocking
      image in the glass, in mingled doubt and irony, clung to her meditations.
      Had she ever meant to be wicked&mdash;ever deliberately, or even
      consciously, chosen evil instead of good? No! There was no dubious
      reservation in her answer. Yet within the week&mdash;oh, the horrible
      week!&mdash;she had come to occupy a moral position for which hell could
      not hold too relentless or fierce a punishment. She had hugged to her
      heart thoughts which, when they are linked with acts, go to expiation on
      the gallows. She shuddered now at the recollection of them; she could
      recall that she had shuddered then, too. Yet all the same these thoughts
      were a part of her&mdash;belonged to her. She had not repelled them as
      alien, or as unwelcome. Even while in terror at their mien, she had
      embraced them. Was this not all wickedness?
    </p>
    <p>
      The reply came, in sophistical self-defense, that no one act or emotion of
      a life could be judged by itself. The antecedent circumstances, leading up
      to it, must be taken into account. She had been borne along on the current
      of a career shaped for her by others. She was not responsible&mdash;she
      had never fought with her destiny&mdash;she had done nothing but seek to
      bring some flowers and light and color into the desolate voyage of life.
      Was it fair to say that these little innocent, womanish efforts to soften
      a sterile existence were the cause of the shipwreck&mdash;that it was
      these which had brought her so suddenly, dazed and terrified, into the
      very breakers on the sinister rocks of crime? No, the answer came again;
      surely it could not be fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet she had hated her husband; she had been overjoyed, even while she was
      affrighted, by the news of his death&mdash;or at least there was a
      tremulous sensation very like joy; she had hailed as her deliverer the
      young man whom her wild fancy made responsible for that death&mdash;yes,
      had even in her frenzy kissed his hand, the hand which she then believed
      to have blood upon it, his brother&rsquo;s blood! her husband&rsquo;s blood! Were not
      these the thoughts and actions of a wicked woman? What difference was
      there between her and the vilest murderess confined for life in a
      penitentiary?
    </p>
    <p>
      Or no! What nonsense this was! What single thing had she said or done to
      bring on the catastrophe? It was an accident&mdash;everybody knew that
      now. But even if it had not been an accident, how would she have been to
      blame? Was it her fault that she was pleasing in men&rsquo;s eyes, or that Seth
      had been attracted by her, and had been sympathetic to her? How could she
      have helped it? Was there any reason why she should have tried to help it?
      Was it wrong for her, exiled as she was to this miserable farm life, to
      make a friend of her cousin&mdash;her husband&rsquo;s brother? And if they had
      grown to be attached to each other, could it be wondered at?
    </p>
    <p>
      And it had all been so innocent, too! What single compromising word, even,
      had ever been spoken! Might not the most blameless of women have had just
      such a pretty little romantic friendship, without dream of harm?
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the frantic things she had thought and said on that awful forenoon
      after the discovery, she strove to put them away from her memory, as born
      of a hysterical, wholly irresponsible state.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they would come back, no matter how often banished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, too&mdash;perhaps worst of all, for honest John seemed to lay
      particular stress upon it&mdash;was the terrible declaration she had made
      to Annie. About this there could be no self-deception. She would not
      pretend to herself that this had been done through any but revengeful?
      spiteful motives&mdash;pure cruelty, in fact. But was she to be thus
      coolly pushed aside, her romance shattered, her dear day-dream dissipated&mdash;and
      not to be justified in striking back?
    </p>
    <p>
      This conceited boy&mdash;she was able thus to think of Seth now, in his
      absence, and in the light of the affront she felt he had put upon her&mdash;and
      this country school-teacher, to come billing and cooing in the very hour
      of her supreme excitement&mdash;did they not deserve just what they had
      received? After all, her words had done no permanent harm.. Doubtless by
      this time they had all been cleared up. And if Miss Annie <i>did</i>
      suffer a little, what better was she than other people, to be free all her
      life from heartaches?
    </p>
    <p>
      But then came a mental picture of Annie&rsquo;s calm, sweet, lightful face
      transfixed with speechless horror at the brutal words&mdash;and after it,
      close and searching, the question: &ldquo;Why should I have stabbed Annie? She
      was always kindness itself to me. Was it not heartless to make that poor
      girl suffer?&rdquo; And there followed in her mind, as an echo of her first
      exclamation to the mirror&mdash;that had gathered reverberating force from
      all the thoughts we have striven to trace&mdash;the haunting cry: &ldquo;A
      wicked woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Afternoon came, and the battle still went on. Bitter condemnation of her
      own conduct struggled with angry pleas of grievance against others, and
      the conflict wearied her into what threatened to be a sick headache. The
      idea of getting out into the open air and seeking relief in a walk, which
      had been dormantly in her mind all day, finally took form, and led her
      outside the homestead for the first time since her husband&rsquo;s death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once outside, she walked aimlessly through the orchard&mdash;in preference
      to the high road, where she might meet neighbors&mdash;toward the little
      family graveyard. It was not until she had nearly reached this spot that
      she recalled having heard that Seth, too, came here on that terrible
      night. The recollection brought an added sense of all the wrongs she held
      to have been done her. She stood for a long time by the old board fence,
      with its coating of dry, mildew-like moss on the weather-beaten surfaces
      turned to the north, and its inhospitable hedging of brown, half-bare
      briars, and looked in reverie upon the tombs within the enclosure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three generations of the Fairchilds lay here under the straggling mat of
      withered strawberry vines. She saw the low blue-slate slabs, nearly
      covered now by aspiring weeds and brambles, which modestly pleaded in
      antique letters that the original shoemaker, Roger, and his lowly spouse
      might not be altogether forgotten. Rising ostentatiously above these
      timid, ancient memorials, as if with intent to divert attention from their
      humility, was the marble obelisk marking the resting-place of the family&rsquo;s
      greatest man, the Hon. Seth Fairchild. The monument was not so white or so
      imposing now as it once had been, and the proud inscription setting forth
      how its subject had been &ldquo;twice Senator of the State of New York,&rdquo; was
      almost illegible from the storm-stains and mould on its venerable front.
      There were some other stones, gray and small, tipping humbly toward the
      central monolith, as if mutely begging at least a little share of the
      Senator&rsquo;s greatness for his wife and sisters, and nearer were two plain
      modern slabs recounting the sole interesting facts of the colorless lives
      of Lemuel and Cicely Fair-child&mdash;that they had been alive, and now
      were dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here still nearer her, almost at her feet, the widow saw some pegs driven
      in the ground, with string stretched around them to form a long rectangle.
      The sight brought no thrill to her. She was conscious of all its meaning,
      but felt herself scarcely interested. In life she had owed nothing but
      dislike to the man whose last coming these signs of preparation betokened.
      His death had shocked her at first by its fearful suddenness; it did not
      especially disturb her now, save at times with a furtive elation at the
      accompanying thought that at last she was free. Her thoughts were with the
      living&mdash;and their relation to those long since dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      If these rambling thoughts could have been summarized in words they would
      have run in this fashion:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has all your family pride brought you, all your planning and
      manoeuvring, you dull countrymen? <i>I</i> wasn&rsquo;t good enough for you, eh?
      Your breed must conspire against me, eh? and treat me like an interloper,
      an outsider, eh? You thought I was to be brought here too, did you, when
      my time arrived, and be snubbed and bullied into some back corner like the
      rest of your wives, while my husband, &lsquo;the Congressman,&rsquo; had a big
      monument like this of your old humbug, the Senator? And you expected to
      patronize me, or cut me dead, as the living dolts here on the turnpike
      have done, did you? Well, you are fooled! I&rsquo;ve escaped you! I shall never
      come here but once again&mdash;to bring you your &lsquo;Congressman.&rsquo; You can
      have him and welcome. And that old cat of an aunt of his, she will come
      presently, too, and I wish you much joy of <i>her!</i> And perhaps you
      will give up your idea, then, that you amount to anything, or ever will
      amount to anything. The farm is going to a young man who will sell it, and
      who doesn&rsquo;t care a cent for the whole crowd of you, and who will live in a
      city, and eat with his fork, and forget that there ever were such people
      as you. And he will forget, too, that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She came to a full stop in her meditations. Yes, Seth would forget her,
      too. She had no illusions on this point. Perhaps this was too kindly a
      view of it, even&mdash;he might be compelled to remember her by sheer
      force of his bitterness toward her. There could be no doubt, after his
      cruel words on the eventful forenoon&mdash;their last meeting&mdash;that
      he scorned and despised her. What an idiot she had been to disclose to him
      her thoughts&mdash;those mad fancies and beliefs of that frantic morning!
      She might have known that the idea of his fighting his brother, on <i>her</i>
      account, was preposterous. What did he care about her? He had been nice
      with her, had written her pretty, graceful letters when she asked him to
      do so, and had sent her books to read&mdash;that was all. There was
      nothing else. She had been a fool to dream that there was anything else.
      He would sell the farm, and go back to Tecumseh, and marry Annie&mdash;yes,
      marry Annie! And they, too, would refer to her now and then, and comment
      on her wickedness, and hope that they might never have a daughter like
      her. That would be all.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned from the little enclosure of graves, without giving them
      another thought. The mental picture which she conjured up of the young
      couple, contented by a fireside of their own, perhaps with a child, tore
      at her heart-strings.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the farm-yard she was met by Mr. Ansdell, who was evidently watching
      for her, and who introduced himself courteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Coroner is here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;with some medical gentlemen, and there
      are also your late husband&rsquo;s partner, Mr. Hubbard, who accompanied me from
      New York last night, and the District Attorney and some others. In a
      couple of hours or so we expect to be able to tell you what brought us.
      Meanwhile, we are anxious to spare you any possible intrusion&mdash;and
      also a possible scene. It is for this that I have waited outside for you.
      If you could prolong your walk for that length of time, going to some
      friend&rsquo;s house near by, for instance, without saying that anything unusual
      was transpiring here&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will go,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Will two hours be long enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; he said, bowing his thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked out through the great swing-gate to the turnpike, and idly
      chose the westward turning, along under the poplars. The curious incident
      of all these visitors at the house did not excite her attention. Her mind
      was too busy torturing itself with that marriage which was already spoken
      of as assured.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the stile by the thorns, the idea of going to the Warren house suddenly
      occurred to her. It was a bold, purposeless, almost crazy thought; perhaps
      for those very reasons it commended itself to her mood. She felt herself
      impelled alike by good and malignant impulses to cross the stile; she
      walked down the thorn path, scarcely knowing whether her purpose was to
      bless or to curse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was opened by Samantha, whose scared face took on an added
      expression of anxiety on recognizing the visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go into the parlor, &rsquo;n&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll light the stove fer yeh,&rdquo; she
      whispered. &ldquo;Th&rsquo; old lady&rsquo;s very laow. Soon&rsquo;s she comes hum from schewl
      I&rsquo;ll send Annie in to see yeh.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII.&mdash;THE SHERIFF ASSISTS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hile Isabel sat
      over the stove in the cold, austere parlor of the Warren house, with its
      ancient furniture, the never failing photograph album, and those huge pink
      shells on the mantle-shelf without which no rural home used to be complete&mdash;waiting
      for she scarcely knew what&mdash;strange things were going forward in the
      home of the Fairchilds.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the forenoon of this same day, Thursday, there had been a gathering in
      the office of the Thessaly <i>Banner of Liberty</i>. It was the
      publication day of the paper, but for once it went to press without
      enlisting even the most careless scrutiny, let alone the solicitude, of
      its editor-proprietor. He had more serious business on hand. Closeted with
      him in the little editorial room, whose limited space had rarely before
      been so taxed, were Beekman, Ansdell, the District Attorney, the Sheriff,
      and the younger of the dead man&rsquo;s two New York partners, a shrewd, silent,
      long-faced man. Seth had desired to be of the party but his brother had
      sent him off, to return after dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      These men gravely discussed some subjects with which our readers are
      familiar, and some now first brought to light. John had a letter from
      Annie, sent by hand the previous evening, detailing the strange things
      Milton had said to her about the black mare. Ansdell and Mr. Hubbard, the
      partner, recited how they had discovered that Albert Fairchild, on the
      preceding Monday, sold $16,000 worth of government bonds, and the abortive
      effort he made to so arrange the transfer that it would not be traced.
      Beekman recalled how the black mare had balked on the edge of the gulf the
      day after the murder&mdash;for they all thus characterized it now. Later,
      the Coroner came in by appointment, and in the presence of the dreaded
      District Attorney was meekness itself. He even heard that two physicians
      were to go out with the party, and make an examination, without taking
      offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the noon-day dinner the gathering was reinforced by the two doctors
      and by Seth, the latter devoured by curiosity and vexed at being kept so
      long in the dark. Soon after, all of the party save the Sheriff made their
      way to the Fairchild house, driving by twos or threes, and at intervals,
      to avoid exciting suspicion. It was after the arrival of the last division
      that Ansdell met Isabel, and advised her to stay away from the house for a
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two surgeons and the Coroner went silently into the parlor, and closed
      the door behind them. In the living-room Ansdell, Hubbard, John, and the
      District Attorney took chairs around the stove, having given word that
      Milton, who was off on the other side of the hill, arranging the sale of
      some apples, should be sent in to them when he arrived, which could not be
      very long now. In the kitchen, opening back from the living-room as this
      in turn did from the parlor, Seth and Beekman sat with the three women of
      the household.
    </p>
    <p>
      These latter had been told that something was going on, or rather had
      inferred it from being forbidden to leave the room, and were agog with
      puzzled excitement. They had no clue, save a vague understanding that
      important personages were in the front portions of the house, but Alvira
      and Melissa stole unhappy glances toward Seth, in uneasy fear that the
      worst suspicions born of Samantha&rsquo;s recital were to be realized in fact.
      Aunt Sabrina, sitting with her shawl wrapped about her gaunt shoulders,
      and with her feet on a piece of wood in the oven, did not know of this
      story which gave point to the other women&rsquo;s anxiety, but was in misery
      between a deep yearning to learn what had happened, and a pessimistic
      conviction that it must be another addition to the Fairchilds&rsquo; load of
      calamities.
    </p>
    <p>
      They heard Milton drive up presently, and hail Dana with instructions to
      put the horse out, and a query concerning the several strange vehicles
      under the shed. Then he came into the kitchen, stamping his feet with the
      cold, and walking straight to the stove to warm his hands. It was growing
      dark in the low room, and he did not recognize Beekman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seth delivered his errand, saying that his brother John wished to see
      Milton, as soon as he returned, in the living-room. The hired man gave the
      speaker a curious glance, and, after a moment or two of hand warming, went
      in to learn what was wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost as he closed the door behind him, the Sheriff entered the kitchen
      from the outside, and after an interrogative glance toward Beekman, which
      the latter answered by a nod, drew up a chair leisurely by the stove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;d a thought it &rsquo;d a turned out so cold, &lsquo;fore the moon
      changed?&rdquo; he asked of the company collectively. &ldquo;Hev yeh got any cider
      abaout handy? &rsquo;N&rsquo; a daoughnut, tew, ef yeh don&rsquo;t mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Melissa was in the cellar, the Sheriff, who was a Spartacus man and
      a stranger to both Seth and the females, asked of Beekman: &ldquo;What did yeh
      agree on fer a sign?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Th&rsquo; shakin&rsquo; of th&rsquo; stove.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth had been annoyed all day at the pains taken by John to keep the facts
      of the enterprise now in hand from him, and he displayed so much of this
      pique in the glance he now cast from the Sheriff to Beekman, that the
      latter felt impelled to speak:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P&rsquo;raps you disremember my askin&rsquo; yeh &rsquo;t&rsquo; other day &rsquo;baout
      whether yer brother had much money on him that night. Well, we&rsquo;ve settled
      thet point. He did hev&rsquo;&mdash;&rsquo;n&rsquo; &rsquo;twas a considerable sum
      tew&mdash;&lsquo;baout sixteen thaousan&rsquo; dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; Seth&rsquo;s exclamation was of incredulous surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sixteen thaousan&rsquo;. We knaow it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I remember now,&rdquo; said Seth, searching his impressions of the night.
      &ldquo;I remember that when I said he might fail to be nominated, he slapped his
      breast two or three times as if he had something in the pocket. By George!
      I wonder&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yeh needn&rsquo;t waste no more time wond&rsquo;rin&rsquo;. Thet was it! &rsquo;N&rsquo; d&rsquo;yeh
      knaow what he was goin&rsquo; to dew with thet money? No, yeh daon&rsquo;t! He was
      agoin&rsquo; to buy me! I wouldn&rsquo;t say this afore aoutsiders; I dunnao&rsquo;s I&rsquo;d say
      it to yeou ef your paper wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t so dum fond o&rsquo; pitchin&rsquo; into me fer
      a boss, &rsquo;n&rsquo; a machine man ez yeh call it, &rsquo;n&rsquo; thet kine o&rsquo;
      thing. Yer brother hed th&rsquo; same idee o&rsquo; me thet your paper&rsquo;s got. He was
      wrong. They tell me ther air&rsquo; some country caounties in th&rsquo; State where
      money makes th&rsquo; mare gao. But Jay ain&rsquo;t one of &rsquo;em. Yer brother
      wanted to git into Congress. Ther was nao chance fer him in New York City.
      He come up here &rsquo;n&rsquo; he worked things pooty fine, I&rsquo;m baoun&rsquo; to say,
      but he slipped up on me. Bribes may dew in yer big cities, but they won&rsquo;t
      go daown in Jay. I don&rsquo;t b&rsquo;lieve they&rsquo;s ez much of it done anywhere ez
      folks think, nuther.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this money, then, was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lemme go on! P&rsquo;raps this &rsquo;d never be&rsquo;n faound aout, ef yer brother
      hadn&rsquo;t made mistake number tew in pickin&rsquo; aout the wust &rsquo;n&rsquo; meanest
      cuss in th&rsquo; caounty to be his gao-between. I kin tell mean cusses when I
      see &rsquo;em, &rsquo;n&rsquo; this feller he had was jest <i>the</i> dirtiest
      scalawag I ever did see. I kin stan&rsquo; a scoundrel in a way ef he&rsquo;s bright
      abaout it, but this was a reg&rsquo;lar, natchul born fool. Somehaow in th&rsquo;
      kentry, these men don&rsquo;t seem to hev no sense. Ef they&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to rob a
      man, or set his barns afire, or kill him, they dew it in the darnedest,
      clumsiest saort o&rsquo; way, so they&rsquo;re sure to git faound aout the minute
      anybody looks an inch beyond his nose into th&rsquo; thing. It makes a man
      ashamed to be a kentry-man to see th&rsquo; foolish way these here blockheads
      git caught, ev&rsquo;ry time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The women had been listening intently to this monologue. They looked at
      one another now, with the light of a strange new suspicion in their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is this man? Who are you talking about?&rdquo; Seth asked eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the sound of a stove being shaken vigorously came from the
      living-room. The Sheriff rose to his feet, and strode toward the door of
      this room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll shaow him to yeh in th&rsquo; jerk of a lamb&rsquo;s tail,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation in the living-room, after Milton entered, had been
      trivial for a time, then all at once very interesting. He had been
      disagreeably surprised at finding three men with John, but had taken a
      seat, his big hands hanging awkwardly over his knees, and had been
      reassured somewhat by the explanation that Mr. Hubbard, the dead man&rsquo;s
      partner, was anxious to hear all he could about the sad occurrence. The
      District Attorney he did not know by sight, and he did not recognize
      Ansdell, who stood looking out of the window, softly drumming on the
      panes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milton told a lot of details, about Albert&rsquo;s return, about hitching up the
      grays for him, about how the news was received at the Convention and the
      like, all recited with verbose indirectness, and at great length. Once he
      stopped, his attention being directed to a slight sound in the parlor, and
      looked inquiry. John promptly explained that it was the undertaker, and
      the hired man went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the District Attorney, who had hitherto been silent, asked
      quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You went back to the stable&mdash;to your own room&mdash;after Mr.
      Fairchild drove away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, &rsquo;n&rsquo; went to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear any one enter the stables afterward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nary a soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a black mare in the stables, used under the saddle. Was she
      taken out that night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not thet I knaow of. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there seems to be a pretty positive story that she was. She was
      seen on the road, in fact, late that night, coming from the ravine. The
      rider was not recognized, but the mare was. How do you account for that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tain&rsquo;t none o&rsquo; my business to &rsquo;caount for it.&rdquo; Milton did not like
      the tendency of the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I know that, but we are interested in finding out. I don&rsquo;t think you
      know me&mdash;I am the District Attorney&mdash;and I shall take particular
      pains to find out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A gulf suddenly yawned before Milton&rsquo;s feet, and he made a prompt, bold
      attempt to leap it. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t like to say nothin&rsquo; &rsquo;baout it, bein&rsquo;
      as it&rsquo;s in th&rsquo; fam&rsquo;ly&rdquo;&mdash;he cast an uneasy glance at John here&mdash;&ldquo;but
      Seth Fairchild rides th&rsquo; mare a good deal. I did hear somebody saddlin&rsquo;
      th&rsquo; mare, but I took it fer granted it was him, &rsquo;n&rsquo; sao I didn&rsquo;t
      git up. It&rsquo;d be jes like him, I said to myself, to go ridin&rsquo; in th&rsquo;
      moonshine. He&rsquo;s thet sort of a feller, naow ain&rsquo;t he, John?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sound of his own voice frightened Milton as he went on, and his
      closing appeal to the brother for corroboration carried the nervous accent
      of fear. John did not answer, but rose and walked over to join Ansdell at
      the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of caourse,&rdquo; Milton began, in a lower voice, to which he sought to give a
      confidential tone, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wan&rsquo; to say nothin&rsquo; agin Seth. Of caourse,
      he&rsquo;s John&rsquo;s brother, &lsquo;n&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words were cut short by the rolling back of one of the parlor doors,
      and the entrance of the three doctors. The Coroner, who came last, pulled
      the door shut again. The older of the other two came to the District
      Attorney and said, with deliberate distinctness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are both prepared to swear that Mr. Fairchild&rsquo;s death was caused by a
      gunshot wound in the head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was then that John sprang to the stove, and shook its grate vehemently.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sight of the Sheriff, who advanced upon him with a directness which
      left no ambiguity as to his purpose, Milton rose excitedly from his chair,
      cast a swift scared glance around the company, and then, while the
      handcuffs were being snapped upon his wrists, began to whimper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do it! It&rsquo;s a put-up job! It&rsquo;s them brothers o&rsquo; his thet allus
      hankered after his money, &rsquo;n&rsquo; naow they got it they&rsquo;re tryin&rsquo; to
      put the thing on me. &rsquo;N&rsquo; his wife, tew, thet stuck-up city gal, she&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come naow, yeou better shut up,&rdquo; said the Sheriff sententiously. &ldquo;Th&rsquo;
      more yeh say th&rsquo; wuss it&rsquo;ll be fer yeh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Most of the men present averted their gaze during the brief period of
      alternate threats and cringing, of rough curses and frenzied fawning on
      the Sheriff, the District Attorney, and even the Coroner, which ensued;
      but Mr. Hubbard watched it all carefully with evident interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a very curious type of criminal,&rdquo; he said, as the Sheriff and his
      prisoner left the room; &ldquo;very curious indeed! I never saw a murderer
      before who had so little nerve, and funked so absolutely when he was
      confronted with detection. Why, I&rsquo;ve seen men, guilty as guilty could be,
      who would deceive even their own lawyers. But such a simpleton as that&mdash;he&rsquo;s
      not worth his rope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is because you are a city man,&rdquo; explained the District Attorney.
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know the kind of murderers we raise here in the country. The
      chances are that your city assassin would be tortured by remorse, if he
      escaped discovery, and that he committed the deed in a moment of passion.
      But the rural murderer (I am speaking of native Americans, now) plans the
      thing in cold blood, and goes at it systematically, with nerves like
      steel. He generally even mutilates the body, or does some other horrible
      thing, which it makes everybody&rsquo;s blood boil to think of. And so long as
      he isn&rsquo;t found out, he never dreams of remorse. He has no more moral
      perspective than a woodchuck. But when detection does come, it knocks him
      all in a heap. He blubbers, and tries to lay it on somebody else, and
      altogether acts like a cur&mdash;just as this fellow &rsquo;s doing now,
      for instance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A hubbub of shrieks and sobs rose from the kitchen as he finished this
      sentence, and they with one accord moved toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sheriff, with an eye to his promise to the two men in the kitchen, had
      led the livid and slinking wretch out to the centre of the room, where the
      dim candles had now been lighted, and, forcing him to hold up his hands so
      that the manacles might be fully visible, said to Seth:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here yeh air! I said I&rsquo;d shaow him to yeh! Here is the whelp thet did th&rsquo;
      mischief. Look at him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a second of dead silence, as the several listeners took in the
      significance of his words, and of the spectacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence was broken by an inarticulate, indescribable cry from Aunt
      Sabrina. Then came with startling swiftness a confusion of moving bodies,
      of screams, and the rattling of the handcuffs&rsquo; chain, which no one could
      follow. When the intervention of the Sheriff and Beekman had restored
      quiet, it was discovered that the old lady, with an agility of which none
      could have supposed her capable, had snatched a potato knife from the
      table, and made a savage attempt to wreak the family&rsquo;s vengeance upon
      Milton. She had not succeeded in inflicting any injury, save a slight cut
      on one of his pinioned hands, and Seth now with some difficulty persuaded
      her to leave the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It fell to Alvira&rsquo;s lot to bind up the bleeding hand&mdash;for Melissa,
      undertaking the task, was too nervous and trembling to perform it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little dialogue, in hushed whispers, which only imperfectly reached even
      the sentinel Sheriff, ensued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sao this is what yeh&rsquo;ve come tew!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all a lie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t tell <i>me!</i> Ef you&rsquo;d be&rsquo;n contented with yer lot in life,
      &rsquo;n&rsquo; hadn&rsquo;t tried to swell yerself up like a toad in a puddle, this
      wouldn&rsquo;t a happen&rsquo;d. But nao, yeh poor fewl, yeh must set yerself up to <i>be</i>
      somebody! &rsquo;N&rsquo; naow where air yeh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Words with which to answer rose to Milton&rsquo;s bloodless lips, but he could
      not give them utterance. He could not even look at her, but in a dazed way
      stared at the hand, which he held so that she could wind the bandage in
      spite of the gyves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t use to think yeh was aout-&rsquo;n-aout bad,&rdquo; she continued, more
      slowly; &ldquo;they was a time when yeh might a made a decent man o&rsquo; yerself&mdash;ef
      yeh&rsquo;d kep&rsquo; yer word to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time he did not make an effort to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The task of sustaining the talk alone was too great for her. The tears
      came into her eyes, and blinded the last touches to the bandage. As it was
      completed, the Sheriff put his hand roughly on the prisoner&rsquo;s shoulder.
      The meaning of this movement spread over her mind, and appalled her. With
      a gesture of decision she stood on tiptoe, lifted her face up to Milton&rsquo;s,
      and kissed him. Then, as he was led away, she turned to the onlookers, and
      said defiantly, between incipient sobs:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daon&rsquo;t keer! Ef t&rsquo; was th&rsquo; last thing I ever done in my life, I&rsquo;d dew
      it. We was&mdash;engaged&mdash;once&rsquo;t on a time!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXXIV.&mdash;AT &ldquo;M&rsquo;TILDY&rsquo;S&rdquo; BEDSIDE AGAIN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>o you clip over
      and tell Annie,&rdquo; John had said to Seth, when the first excitement of the
      scene had passed off, and they stood at the kitchen window, watching the
      Sheriff&rsquo;s buggy fade off in the dusk down the hill toward Thessaly jail.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the thing for you to do&mdash;the quicker the better!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annie had been home from her day&rsquo;s task some minutes, and sat by her
      grandmother&rsquo;s bedside. The patient was in a semi-comatose state, breathing
      with unnatural heaviness, and Samantha had been dispatched with all haste
      to bring a doctor from Thessaly. It seemed terribly probable that Mrs.
      Warren&rsquo;s last day had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet as she sat by the curtained recess, holding in her&rsquo;s the withered hand
      which lay inanimate on the high edge of the bed, Annie still thought very
      little of the great change impending over her home; she had faced this
      death in life so long that its climax did not startle her, or wear the
      garb of strangeness. Instead, she was pondering the unaccountable,
      unwelcome fact with which Samantha had greeted her on her return&mdash;that
      Isabel was in the adjoining room, and had asked to see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could it mean? What could Isabel&rsquo;s purpose be in coming? And ought
      she to sacrifice her own feelings to the dictates of politeness, and go in
      to see this wicked, cruel woman? Perhaps she had come to retract and
      apologize for the fearful words of Tuesday. Perhaps her intention was to
      reiterate them, or worse, to recount that now the whole world would know
      of them&mdash;and gloat over her pain. No, that could scarcely be, for
      since her interview with Milton Annie felt satisfied at least of Seth&rsquo;s
      innocence. But still something new might have been disclosed&mdash;Isabel
      might have evil tidings of some sort with which to overwhelm her afresh.
      What should she do?
    </p>
    <p>
      The parlor door was ajar, and though she could not see her visitor, she
      could plainly hear the snapping of the wood fire within, which Samantha
      had kindled. Isabel must be perfectly aware of her return, and of her
      presence in this sick chamber. Every minute that she hesitated would only
      augment the widow&rsquo;s anger at being thus inhospitably neglected. Even if
      she had relented, and had come with kindly intent, this reception might
      alter her impulses.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose to enter the parlor, but still stood irresolute, holding her
      grandmother&rsquo;s hand, when there came the sound of footsteps in the front
      hall&mdash;then of a hasty knock on the door opening from the hall into
      this room in which she was. She opened the door, and before her, excited
      and jubilant, stood her cousin Seth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to tell you!&rdquo; he burst out, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all cleared up. There <i>was</i>
      a murder. Milton did it! He&rsquo;s just been arrested! I tried to ring your
      bell, but it didn&rsquo;t seem to work. So I <i>had</i> to come in! And now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened his arms with an unmistakable gesture, and they closed fondly
      upon an overjoyed maiden, who sobbed upon his breast for very relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she found breath and words, it was to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you can&rsquo;t guess what I have suffered these last two days; I thought I
      should never live through them! And now it seems as if I should go wild
      with joy&mdash;as if I couldn&rsquo;t keep my feet down on the floor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I know, my darling. But we shall be all the happier for this
      spell of wretchedness. Dry your eyes, pet. There shall be no more thought
      or talk of tears&mdash;much less of dying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Seth!&mdash;I forgot!&mdash;my grandmother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lowered her voice, and told him her fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hand in hand, and with his arm about her shoulder, they moved softly to
      the bedside of the dying woman. The noise of the talking, or some less
      apparent influence, had aroused her from her lethargy. Her pale eyes were
      brilliant still, with an unearthly light, it seemed to the awed young man,
      and she rested their gaze fixedly upon the couple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; she asked in a querulous whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Seth, Granny,&rdquo; the girl answered, relapsing unconsciously into the
      familiar form she had not used since childhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aged woman restlessly moved her head, and her eyes snapped with
      impatience at her inability to raise herself from the pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have him here! Tell him to take his arm away. What&rsquo;s he doin&rsquo;
      here, anyway? He desarted yeh! His own father told me so! Tell him to go
      away! I hate the sight of the hull breed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s come back to me, Granny,&rdquo; the girl pleaded, while Seth shrank
      backward in the shadow of the curtain. &ldquo;Truly he has, and he&rsquo;s not to
      blame. And I love him very dearly&rdquo;&mdash;a pressure from the young man&rsquo;s
      hand answered the sweetness of this avowal&mdash;&ldquo;and he will be all I
      shall have left when&mdash;when&mdash;&rdquo; she stopped, unwilling to conclude
      her thought in words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An&rsquo; will he take yeh away, an&rsquo; do by yeh ez a husban&rsquo; ought to do, or
      will he take yeh onto that Fairchild farm, an&rsquo; break yer heart out ez his
      father did his mother&rsquo;s, an&rsquo; ez his uncle did yer mother&rsquo;s, an&rsquo; ez his
      brother, so they tell me, is doin&rsquo; with his wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mercy!&rdquo; the girl exclaimed, involuntarily; then she whispered to
      Seth, back of the curtains: &ldquo;What shall I do! I forgot all about it&mdash;Isabel
      is there in the parlor and she has heard every word we&rsquo;ve said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The quick ears of the invalid caught the whispered explanation. .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isabel!&rdquo; she said, sharply. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Albert Fairchild&rsquo;s wife ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; the girl answered. She tried in dumb show to convey to Seth that
      her grandmother was ignorant of his brother&rsquo;s death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go an&rsquo; fetch her in here,&rdquo; said Mrs. Warren, with more animation in her
      voice than it had shown before. &ldquo;I want to see her&mdash;to talk with
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Granny, you ought&rsquo;nt to see strangers; you know, the doctor&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess she ain&rsquo;t much more of a stranger than this young man you&rsquo;ve got
      here. Go an&rsquo; fetch her, I say! I won&rsquo;t hurt her, an&rsquo; she won&rsquo;t hurt me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing for Annie to do, but go into the parlor, and bow
      shamefacedly to Isabel, and say, with embarrassment in every syllable:
      &ldquo;Excuse me for not coming before, but I think my grandmother is dying. She
      wants very much to see you. Won&rsquo;t you come, please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel had risen to her feet upon Annie&rsquo;s entrance. To the latter&rsquo;s
      surprise and increased confusion she held forth her hand with a friendly
      gesture. &ldquo;Yes, I will come with you,&rdquo; she said, as Annie doubtingly took
      the proffered hand, and the two women entered the sick-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isabel did not seem to see Seth, who stood at the head of the bed, among
      the drawn curtains, but walked to the bedside and said softly: &ldquo;I am
      Isabel, Mrs. Warren; I am sorry that our first meeting should find you so
      low.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re Albert&rsquo;s wife, eh?&rdquo; The old woman eyed her keenly, for what
      seemed a long time. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heered tell o&rsquo; you. Would you mind gettin&rsquo; that
      candle there, on the mantle-piece, an&rsquo; holdin&rsquo; it, so&rsquo;t I kin see yer
      face?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel gravely complied with the request, and stood before the invalid
      again, with the yellow light glowing upon her throat and lower chin and
      nostrils and full, Madonna-like brows. Her face was at its best with this
      illumination from below. She would have been a rare beauty close before
      the footlights.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Warren, after a long inspection, &ldquo;P&rsquo;raps it&rsquo;ll sound
      ridiculous to yeh, but yeh don&rsquo;t look unlike what I did when I was your
      age. The farm ain&rsquo;t had time to tell on yeh yit. But it will! It made me
      the skeercrow that you see; it&rsquo;ll do the same for you. When I was a girl,
      I was a Thayer, the best fam&rsquo;ly in Norton, Massachusetts. We held our
      heads high, I kin tell yeh. Why, when I brought my side-saddle here,
      stitched with silk, &rsquo;twas the fust one they&rsquo;d ever seen in these
      parts. But I married beneath me, an&rsquo; I come up here into York State to
      live, on this very farm. With us, farmin&rsquo; don&rsquo;t mean a livin&rsquo; death.
      P&rsquo;raps we don&rsquo;t hev sech fine big barns ez yeh build here, but our houses
      are better. We don&rsquo;t git such good crops, but we pay more heed to
      education and godly livin&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s th&rsquo; diff&rsquo;rence &rsquo;twixt folks who
      b&rsquo;lieve there&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; else in life b&rsquo;sides eatin&rsquo; an&rsquo; drinkin&rsquo; an&rsquo;
      makin&rsquo; money, an&rsquo; folks that don&rsquo;t. Well, I left a good home, an&rsquo; I come
      here, an&rsquo; here I am. Look at me! Look at Lemuel Fairchild&rsquo;s wife, Cicely&mdash;she
      was a relation of yours, wasn&rsquo;t she?&mdash;see how the farm made an ole
      woman o&rsquo; her, an&rsquo; broke her down, an&rsquo; killed her! You&rsquo;re young, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;re
      good lookin&rsquo; yit, but it&rsquo;ll break yeh, sure&rsquo;s yer born. Husban&rsquo;s on these
      farms ain&rsquo;t what they air in the cities, nor even in the country in New
      England. I&rsquo;m told your husban&rsquo; don&rsquo;t treat you right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us talk about that&mdash;please!&rdquo; said Isabel: she stole a
      swift, momentary glance toward Seth as she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The keen eyes in the recess followed this look. &ldquo;Well, no,&rdquo; the husky,
      whispering voice went on, &ldquo;p&rsquo;raps it ain&rsquo;t none o&rsquo; my business. But tell
      me about this young man here&mdash;yer husband&rsquo;s brother. I want to know
      about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about him?&rdquo; asked Isabel slowly, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, is he a likely man? Air his habits good? Could he take this girl o&rsquo;
      mine&mdash;an&rsquo; she&rsquo;s a good girl, Annie is&mdash;could he take her to
      Tecumsy, an&rsquo; make a fit home fer her? An&rsquo; <i>would</i> he do it? Would he
      make her a good husban&rsquo;&mdash;ez good ez she desarves? I ask you, &rsquo;cause
      you know him. I leave it to you&mdash;would you yerself marry him ef yeh
      was free, an&rsquo; feel safe about him? Come, now, tell me that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel hesitated so long that the old woman, seemingly wandering a little
      after her long, laborious concentration of thought, broke in again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know &rsquo;em! I know &rsquo;em! Of all the Fair-childses, there
      never was one decent one. They stole my daughter, an&rsquo; let her die &rsquo;mongst
      strangers, an&rsquo; they made a broken ole woman o&rsquo; me, an&rsquo; they slaved
      Cicely&rsquo;s life out o&rsquo; her, an&rsquo; now they want my Annie&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Isabel here, speaking softly, and putting her hand on the
      wasted arm which lay above the coverlet. &ldquo;I think you wrong Seth. Whatever
      the rest may have done, I think he will be a good husband to Annie. I am
      <i>sure</i> he will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No answer, save a low, incoherent murmuring, came from the recess. The
      invalid had lapsed into the lethargy of exhausted nature. As the trio
      stood by the bedside even this sound ceased. Nothing was to be heard but
      the labored, unnatural breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isabel placed the candle again upon the shelf. She had not removed her
      bonnet and wrap, and she turned now irresolutely toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annie went to her, and silently took her hand. &ldquo;I forgive you,&rdquo; she
      whispered. &ldquo;Was there anything else? Did you want to speak to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I wanted when I came. Let me go now. Perhaps if I said
      any more, I should hate myself afterward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And thus, without a glance at Seth, she went.

     </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE story, such as
      it is, is told.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the daily press of the State, which had given great attention to
      the tragedy in Dearborn County, became fairly aware that a mystery
      attached to it, the wretched Milton had confessed his crime. He had
      followed and come up with his employer, who stopped at his call. There was
      a conversation&mdash;then the killing. The prisoner made a weak effort to
      pretend that there was a quarrel first, and that his deed was in
      self-defence, but he deceived no one. He had with much difficulty led the
      grays off the side of the ravine, the murdered man being first thrown
      over, and the horses and buggy purposely hurled down upon him. There was
      some angry criticism when it became known that the District Attorney had
      agreed to accept a plea of murder in the second degree, and the popular
      explanation&mdash;that it was done from motives of consideration for the
      family&mdash;provoked not a few jibes from people who wanted to know why
      the Fairchilds were any better than other folk. But the course of the law
      was not affected by this comment, nor did the District Attorney suffer
      appreciably from it when he came up the succeeding autumn for re-election.
      The money was all recovered&mdash;and, if you have the influence requisite
      to obtain a visiting pass to New York&rsquo;s forest-girt prison on the Eastern
      watershed of the Adirondacks&mdash;that terrible subterranean place of woe
      from which even Siberian gaolers might get some hints of new things in
      anguish&mdash;you may still see a thin, bent, evil-faced wretch dragging
      out existence in the mines, who once was reckoned a likely man in Dearborn
      County, and who cast its united vote at the most famous of all Tyre&rsquo;s
      Conventions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The funeral of Albert Fairchild will long be remembered in all the section
      round. More than one State official attended, and there was a vast
      concourse of lesser political lights, who kept a shrewd eye upon
      opportunities for profitable discourse with each other, before and after
      the services, while they put themselves dignifiedly in evidence before the
      public by getting their names in the local papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were no surprises to the inner circle of the family when the will
      came to be read. Subject to the widow&rsquo;s third, the farm was devised in
      equal parts to the two brothers, but the major share of the other property
      went to Seth. The partner from New York remained at the homestead long
      enough to arrange the details by which the widow&rsquo;s portion was bought by
      the brothers, and her leave-taking accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Fairchild lives in high contentment on the ancestral farm. He grows
      stout now, in the accustomed Fairchild fashion, and though his light ruddy
      face and brown beard are hostile to the suggestion, people profess to see
      the family likeness in him as he grows older. Aunt Sabrina especially
      cherishes this fancy with fondness. She has come to regard this nephew,
      whom once she so deeply disliked, with some affection and vast esteem, and
      she devotes her hours to dreaming of the great things he may accomplish as
      the Fairchild of Dearborn&mdash;what time she is not joining Alvira in
      prayer that he may not be moved to marry a city woman. Thus far there are
      no indications that he thinks of marrying any one, and his ambitions seem
      to take no higher form than the re-invigoration of the <i>Banner of
      Liberty</i>, which he drives over to Thessaly three times a week to
      superintend, and which, they say, promises soon to blossom into a daily.

    <p>
      One closing scene we may glance at&mdash;a pretty room, with modern
      furniture, and wide, flower-clad windows looking upon one of the best of
      Tecum-seh&rsquo;s residential streets. Annie, grown brighter-faced and yet no
      older in looks, despite the nearly four years of married life which have
      gone by, stands at the window with a baby in her arms, and laughs as she
      tosses the infant forward toward the panes, in greeting to the paternal
      parent, who is coming up the front steps. The wife is in gay spirits, not
      only because the head of the house has come home to dinner instead of
      stopping at the Club, but for another reason, compared with which all
      dinners were trivial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Seth, her first tooth has come through!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That so? It&rsquo;s about time, I should-think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His reception of the great tidings is so calm, not to say indifferent,
      that the beaming wife looks at him in mock surprise. Seth has not aged
      specially either, but he wears this evening an unwontedly serious
      expression of face, and gets into his dressing-gown and slippers with an
      almost moody air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baby is brought up in frowning, blinking proximity to her sire and made by
      proxy to demand an explanation of this untoward gloom, on an occasion
      which ought to be given over to rejoicing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m tired,&rdquo; Seth answers; &ldquo;and then&mdash;then I have a letter which
      puzzles and annoys me a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it anything that I know about?&rdquo; Annie has seated herself beside him
      now, and looks sweet inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes. It is a letter from Dent&mdash;you know I&rsquo;ve let him go down
      to Washington to get an idea of the place and the men while the session is
      on&mdash;and along with a letter to the paper, pretty good stuff, too, he
      sends me this personal note. Read it for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annie took the letter, and reads steadily along through its neat
      chirography:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Washington, March 7th.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Fairchild:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I send a letter going into the Silver question from the standpoint of
      some of the Western men I have talked with. They impress me as being more
      sincere than sensible on the subject. I think the trip will be of vast
      service to me&mdash;and also, I trust, to the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last evening, I met for the second time since I have been here, an
      elderly gentleman from your part of the State, named Beekman. Like myself,
      he is down here to look around, and get an idea of things. It is the first
      time, I should judge, that he has been so far away from home, and his
      comments are extremely droll&mdash;often very clever, too. He seems to
      know you very well, and asked me to remember him kindly to you, and
      express his congratulations upon your purchase of a controlling interest
      in the paper. He wanted me to be sure and say to you that while the
      experiment of electing Ansdell had worked very well&mdash;he seems to
      admire Ansdell greatly&mdash;you mustn&rsquo;t allow that to lead you into the
      habit of thinking that all bolters are saints and all straight-party men
      devils. It seems that since he has been here he has encountered some
      foolish and exceptional Southern Congressman who provoked him by saying &lsquo;<i>Your</i>
      Government&rsquo; and <i>your</i> laws&rsquo; instead of using the pronoun and that
      has made him a great Stalwart again&mdash;for the time-being.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annie looked up from the sheet. &ldquo;I must say I don&rsquo;t see anything in all
      this to particularly disturb anybody. This seems just the harmless sort of
      letter I should expect your innocuous Mr. Dent to write.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read the rest of it,&rdquo; was Seth&rsquo;s reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went on:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, I met your sister-in-law among the guests at a reception the
      other evening, to which Mr. Ansdell kindly secured me an invitation. Her
      residence on K street&mdash;she gave me the number, which I have somewhere&mdash;is
      said to be one of the most charming homes in Washington. She is
      very-popular in society here, and I am told that you meet her at every
      fashionable gathering. She was certainly very pleasant with me, when Mr.
      Ansdell presented me and explained who I was. She especially asked me if I
      knew what you had named your baby-girl, but I could not tell her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> could tell her if she asked <i>me!</i>&rdquo; remarked the young wife,
      grimly. &ldquo;The very idea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Seth&mdash;&ldquo;or I shall feel that we ought to have named her
      Proscrastinatia instead of Annie; get to the end of the thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annie got to the end with a single sentence:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, it may interest you&mdash;and I hope you won&rsquo;t be annoyed at
      my mentioning it, and indeed you may very possibly have heard it already&mdash;to
      learn that everybody here seems to understand that Mr. Ansdell is shortly
      to marry your sister-inlaw, and he himself, speaking to me, referred to
      her in a way which amounted to a declaration of the fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there you have it!&rdquo; said Seth slowly, after a long pause in which
      husband and wife looked at each other. &ldquo;That <i>is</i> news, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think so!&rdquo; Annie spoke deliberately, too, turning the letter
      over with a meditative air. &ldquo;I should think so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gravity of his wife&rsquo;s tone seemed to Seth to be more profound than the
      circumstances altogether demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know after all,&rdquo; he said, in half-apology for his own earlier
      confession of gloom, &ldquo;but that it would be a tolerable match. I don&rsquo;t say
      that they would be happy in the sense that we are happy, my girl; but she
      has a great many qualities which would make her a helpful wife to an
      ambitious, successful, masterful sort of public man like Ansdell. Come,
      now, let&rsquo;s be fair to her. Dent says that she is very popular in
      Washington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Annie thoughtfully, drawing her daughter closer to her
      breast, &ldquo;she always will be popular with people who are not married to
      her. Such women are!&rdquo;
     </p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
